    <h1>Doctors &amp; Patients Q&amp;A</h1>
    <p>Understanding expectations, roles, conflicts and compliance in healthcare</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Collect data: What do patients expect from doctors, what do doctors expect from patients?</h2>
    <p>Patients look for technical competence and respectful, clear communication. They expect physicians to diagnose accurately, explain conditions in plain language, listen attentively and involve them in decisions. Patients also value availability, continuity of care, confidentiality and empathy. Doctors, in turn, expect patients to be honest about their symptoms, to respect professional expertise and to follow treatment plans. They appreciate when patients ask questions, attend follow‑up appointments and collaborate by adhering to medication and lifestyle advice.</p>

    <h2>How would you improve the compliance of patients?</h2>
    <p>Improving compliance (also called adherence) depends on building a partnership with patients. Strategies include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strengthening the patient–provider relationship:</strong> Trust and empathy encourage patients to follow recommendations.</li>
      <li><strong>Providing clear instructions:</strong> Use plain language and confirm understanding through teach‑back or written schedules.</li>
      <li><strong>Simplifying regimens:</strong> Reduce the number of doses, align medication times with daily routines and minimise side‑effects.</li>
      <li><strong>Using reminders and supports:</strong> Pill boxes, mobile alerts and involving family members can help patients remember doses.</li>
      <li><strong>Addressing barriers:</strong> Discuss cost concerns, cultural beliefs and side‑effects, and tailor plans to the individual’s lifestyle.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What kind of conflicts did you realise during nursing practice?</h2>
    <p>Conflicts in nursing practice often stem from competing demands. Nurses may experience inter‑role conflict when obligations to advocate for patients clash with instructions from physicians or administrators. Intra‑role conflict can occur when the ethical duty to give each patient adequate attention conflicts with pressures to see more patients in less time. Disagreements over treatment plans, communication styles or workloads can also create interpersonal conflict. Open dialogue, collaboration and mediation are essential for resolving these tensions.</p>

    <h2>Define the social role and types of social role.</h2>
    <p>A <strong>social role</strong> is a set of expected behaviours attached to a particular status or social position. Roles can be:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Ascribed:</strong> Roles we are born into, such as son, daughter or ethnicity.</li>
      <li><strong>Achieved:</strong> Roles we assume through effort, such as doctor, teacher or volunteer.</li>
      <li><strong>Role set:</strong> The cluster of roles associated with a single status (e.g. a doctor is also a colleague and mentor).</li>
      <li><strong>Role strain:</strong> Tension arising from competing expectations within one role.</li>
      <li><strong>Role conflict:</strong> Clashes between the expectations of different roles.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introduce the role theory.</h2>
    <p>Role theory examines how social life is organised through interconnected roles. It emphasises that roles carry expectations (norms) that guide behaviour, that individuals perform roles (role performance) and that roles are interpreted by others. Role theory explains how people learn roles through socialisation, how they negotiate multiple roles and how conflicts or strains can arise when expectations clash. The theory combines structural views of society—where roles maintain social order—with interactionist views that highlight role negotiation and flexibility.</p>

    <h2>Introduce the doctor and the patient roles by Parsons.</h2>
    <p>Sociologist Talcott Parsons conceptualised illness as a form of sanctioned deviance and defined reciprocal roles. The <strong>patient</strong> is temporarily exempt from normal duties and has the right to care, but is obligated to seek competent help, cooperate with treatment and desire recovery. The <strong>doctor</strong> has the right to examine, ask questions and prescribe treatment, but must use specialised knowledge ethically and act in the patient’s best interest. This “sick role” framework explains why medical interactions involve both rights and obligations for both parties.</p>

    <h2>Introduce the factors of the essential asymmetry in the physician-patient relationship.</h2>
    <p>The physician–patient relationship is inherently asymmetrical because doctors possess specialised knowledge, professional status and institutional authority. Patients are often vulnerable due to illness and rely on doctors for diagnosis and treatment. Cultural norms encourage deference to medical expertise, and health‑care systems reinforce hierarchical structures. Even when patients access information online, differences in knowledge and authority mean that power imbalances persist.</p>

    <h2>Introduce the models of the doctor-patient relationship on the different levels of control.</h2>
    <p>Different models describe how control is shared in medical decision‑making:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Paternalistic:</strong> The doctor makes decisions and presents them to the patient, who plays a passive role.</li>
      <li><strong>Informative:</strong> The doctor provides all relevant information, and the patient independently chooses among options.</li>
      <li><strong>Interpretive:</strong> The doctor helps the patient clarify values and recommends treatments consistent with those values.</li>
      <li><strong>Deliberative:</strong> The doctor and patient engage in moral deliberation about the best options; the doctor acts as a teacher or advisor.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These models range from physician dominance to shared decision‑making, reflecting differing degrees of patient autonomy.</p>

    <h2>Introduce the Szasz-Hollander model of the physician-patient interaction.</h2>
    <p>Thomas Szasz and Marc Hollander identified three types of physician–patient interaction:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Activity–passivity:</strong> The doctor acts on a passive patient who is unable to participate (e.g. during surgery).</li>
      <li><strong>Guidance–cooperation:</strong> The doctor directs care and the patient cooperates, suitable for acute illnesses.</li>
      <li><strong>Mutual participation:</strong> The doctor and patient collaborate and share decision‑making, common in chronic disease management.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This typology emphasises how the relationship shifts based on the patient’s ability and willingness to engage.</p>

    <h2>Introduce the barriers of communication during the process of therapy.</h2>
    <p>Communication barriers in therapy include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Language and literacy:</strong> Limited proficiency in the dominant language and low health literacy can lead to misunderstandings.</li>
      <li><strong>Cultural differences:</strong> Patients and providers may have different interpretations of symptoms and treatments.</li>
      <li><strong>Emotional and cognitive factors:</strong> Anxiety, denial or cognitive impairments can hinder comprehension and recall.</li>
      <li><strong>Time constraints:</strong> Short consultations leave little opportunity for detailed explanations and questions.</li>
      <li><strong>Physical environment:</strong> Lack of privacy or frequent interruptions can disrupt communication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is conflict?</h2>
    <p>Conflict arises when individuals or groups pursue incompatible goals or demands. It may be explicit or implicit, interpersonal or intrapersonal. While conflict can lead to tension, it also provides opportunities for change and innovation when managed constructively.</p>

    <h2>Define the role conflict.</h2>
    <p><strong>Role conflict</strong> occurs when the expectations attached to different roles are incompatible. For example, a nurse may struggle to balance professional obligations to patients with family responsibilities. Role conflict can also emerge when a doctor’s duty to provide thorough care clashes with institutional pressure to increase efficiency.</p>

    <h2>Introduce the different types of role conflict.</h2>
    <p>Types of role conflict include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inter‑role conflict:</strong> When expectations of two different roles clash (e.g. clinician vs parent).</li>
      <li><strong>Intra‑role conflict:</strong> When conflicting expectations exist within a single role (e.g. giving quality time to patients versus seeing more patients).</li>
      <li><strong>Role strain:</strong> Difficulty fulfilling all expectations within one role due to limited resources or contradictory demands.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introduce the conflicts in medicine.</h2>
    <p>In medical practice, conflicts arise between professionals (nurses and physicians, specialists and generalists), between clinicians and institutions, and between clinicians and patients. These may involve disagreements over treatment plans, allocation of scarce resources, ethical dilemmas (such as end‑of‑life decisions) or cultural misunderstandings. Managing medical conflicts requires clear communication, ethical deliberation, teamwork and attention to patients’ cultural and psychosocial contexts.</p>

    <h2>What is compliance?</h2>
    <p><strong>Compliance</strong> describes how closely a patient follows a healthcare provider’s recommendations. It implies a more passive relationship where the provider directs and the patient obeys. Because it suggests paternalism, many professionals now prefer the term “adherence.”</p>

    <h2>Introduce the factors related to compliance.</h2>
    <p>Factors influencing compliance include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Patient factors:</strong> Age, cognitive function, mental health, cultural beliefs and social support.</li>
      <li><strong>Disease factors:</strong> Severity and chronicity; asymptomatic conditions may reduce motivation.</li>
      <li><strong>Therapy factors:</strong> Complexity of the regimen, frequency of dosing, side‑effects and cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Healthcare system factors:</strong> Quality of communication, accessibility of services and trust in providers.</li>
      <li><strong>Socioeconomic factors:</strong> Education, financial resources and competing work or family responsibilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is the adherence</h2>
    <p><strong>Adherence</strong> is the extent to which a patient’s behaviour corresponds with an agreed‑upon plan of care. Unlike compliance, adherence emphasises patient autonomy and shared decision‑making. It reflects a collaborative process in which patients and providers work together to design a treatment plan that fits the patient’s circumstances and values.</p>
