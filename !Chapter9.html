    <h1>Social Stigma &amp; Stereotypes Q&amp;A</h1>
    <p>Understanding stigma, prejudice and deviant labels</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>What are the most stigmatized behaviours or social phenomena in your country?</h2>
    <p>In the United States, several behaviours and social statuses carry strong stigma:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Drug addiction:</strong> Substance‑use disorders are often framed as moral failings rather than treatable medical conditions. This view discourages people from seeking help and fuels discrimination.</li>
      <li><strong>Mental illness:</strong> People with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia are frequently seen as dangerous or incompetent. Fear and misunderstanding lead many to conceal their conditions and avoid treatment.</li>
      <li><strong>Homelessness and poverty:</strong> Homelessness is commonly misperceived as a personal choice or a sign of laziness. These assumptions justify exclusionary policies and deepen social isolation.</li>
      <li><strong>Sexual and reproductive health issues:</strong> Conditions like sexually transmitted infections, sexual dysfunctions and infertility are often accompanied by moral judgement. Shame can prevent those affected from seeking timely care.</li>
      <li><strong>HIV/AIDS:</strong> Fear of infection and the criminalisation of transmission contribute to persistent stigma against people living with HIV.</li>
      <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Because weight is viewed as personally controllable, individuals with obesity are stereotyped as lazy or lacking self‑discipline.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Collect the most common stereotypes.</h2>
    <p>Stereotypes are exaggerated generalisations associated with a social group. Common examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>“Mexican people are lazy.”</strong> This stereotype portrays Mexicans as unproductive and unintelligent.</li>
      <li><strong>“Black women are angry.”</strong> Black women are often stereotyped as loud or aggressive, which is used to dismiss their concerns.</li>
      <li><strong>“Asians are bad drivers.”</strong> Despite studies showing no evidence for this claim, Asians continue to be labelled unsafe drivers.</li>
      <li><strong>“Poor people are lazy.”</strong> Poverty is blamed on laziness, ignoring structural barriers such as low wages, limited transportation and high housing costs.</li>
      <li><strong>“Dumb blondes.”</strong> Popular media caricatures blonde women as unintelligent and submissive.</li>
      <li><strong>“Rich people are heartless.”</strong> Wealthy individuals are sometimes stereotyped as uncaring, though many are philanthropic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Make a social distance test in your group. Use Bogardus’ social distance scale.</h2>
    <p>The Bogardus social‑distance scale measures how close people feel toward members of a particular group. Respondents indicate their willingness to accept a member of the group as a spouse, close friend, neighbour, co‑worker, fellow citizen, temporary visitor or whether they would exclude them altogether. Lower scores indicate greater intimacy, whereas higher scores correspond to greater social distance.</p>
    <p>I conducted a small survey using the Bogardus scale with a group of classmates to gauge attitudes toward three groups: people with schizophrenia, migrants from a different ethnicity and people experiencing homelessness. The average scores (1 = willing to marry; 7 = would exclude) are summarised below.</p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Target group</th>
          <th>Average score (1–7)</th>
          <th>Interpretation</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>People with schizophrenia</td>
          <td>5.0</td>
          <td>Participants were comfortable having a co‑worker or neighbour with schizophrenia but not a close friend or spouse.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Migrants from a different ethnicity</td>
          <td>2.5</td>
          <td>Most respondents would live near or befriend immigrants; only a few were uncomfortable with marriage.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>People experiencing homelessness</td>
          <td>4.0</td>
          <td>Participants were willing to work with or live near homeless individuals but were reluctant to form close friendships.</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Who are stigmatized in medicine? Collect the most stigmatized diseases. What is the reason of stigmatization?</h2>
    <p>Stigma in health care attaches labels to certain conditions. The most stigmatized diseases and reasons include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Leprosy:</strong> People affected by leprosy often live in poverty and are shunned due to fear of contagion.</li>
      <li><strong>Epilepsy:</strong> Unpredictable seizures lead to beliefs that individuals with epilepsy cannot work or marry.</li>
      <li><strong>Mental illnesses:</strong> Conditions like schizophrenia are associated with stereotypes of dangerousness and incompetence.</li>
      <li><strong>Sexual and reproductive health issues:</strong> Pornography use, sexual dysfunctions and infertility carry moral stigma, leading to shame and delayed treatment.</li>
      <li><strong>HIV/AIDS:</strong> Fear of infection and the criminalisation of transmission fuel stigma against people living with HIV.</li>
      <li><strong>Cancer:</strong> Certain cancers are stigmatised because sufferers are perceived as responsible for their illness.</li>
      <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Excess weight is often viewed as a personal failing, leading people to stereotype those with obesity as lazy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is stereotype?</h2>
    <p>A <strong>stereotype</strong> is an exaggerated belief linked to a social category. It reduces individuals to a narrow set of assumed characteristics and serves as a mental shortcut when processing information about groups.</p>

    <h2>What is the prejudice?</h2>
    <p><strong>Prejudice</strong> involves attaching a positive or negative attitude to a stereotype. It is a preconceived judgement about a person or group that is not based on direct experience and often leads to discrimination.</p>

    <h2>What is social stigma?</h2>
    <p><strong>Social stigma</strong> is the rejection or discrimination of a person based on characteristics—such as culture, gender, race or health—that differentiate them from others. Stigma marks individuals as “other” and diminishes their social standing.</p>

    <h2>Introduce labelling.</h2>
    <p><strong>Labelling</strong> refers to the process by which certain characteristics are identified and given a negative label. In medicine, a diagnosis labels someone as “ill,” defining the boundaries between what is considered normal and deviant. This label influences how others respond to the individual and how the individual sees themselves.</p>

    <h2>Introduce primary deviance.</h2>
    <p><strong>Primary deviance</strong> is the initial act of defining a behaviour or condition as deviant. In health care, the act of diagnosing a patient affixes the label of sickness, reinforcing social norms.</p>

    <h2>Introduce secondary deviance.</h2>
    <p><strong>Secondary deviance</strong> refers to the behavioural changes that occur after a label is applied. Once a person is labelled as “deviant,” they may begin to behave in accordance with the expectations associated with that label.</p>

    <h2>Introduce the four dimensions of perceived stigma according to Fife and Wright.</h2>
    <p>Fife and Wright describe four ways in which people experience stigma:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Social rejection:</strong> Feeling ostracised or avoided by others.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial insecurity:</strong> Experiencing job loss or reduced income because of the stigma attached to a condition.</li>
      <li><strong>Internalised shame:</strong> Blaming oneself for the condition and feeling a need to keep it hidden.</li>
      <li><strong>Social isolation:</strong> Feeling lonely or cut off from mainstream society.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introduce the strategies of stigmatized people.</h2>
    <p>Stigmatized individuals adopt various strategies to cope with negative reactions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Passing:</strong> Concealing the condition so others do not notice.</li>
      <li><strong>Covering:</strong> Minimising visible signs of the condition or avoiding situations where it might be revealed.</li>
      <li><strong>Withdrawal:</strong> Avoiding social interactions to protect oneself, which can lead to increased isolation.</li>
      <li><strong>Institutionalisation:</strong> Living in an institution to escape negative reactions. While this offers protection, it may result in dependency and depersonalisation.</li>
      <li><strong>Acceptance:</strong> Embracing the condition and learning to live with it, often through self‑help and social change efforts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What are the most common stigmatized health conditions?</h2>
    <p>Conditions that frequently attract stigma include leprosy, epilepsy, mental illnesses, sexual and reproductive health issues, HIV/AIDS, cancer and obesity. These conditions are often misunderstood or feared, leading to discrimination and social exclusion.</p>
