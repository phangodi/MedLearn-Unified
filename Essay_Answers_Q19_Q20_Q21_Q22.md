## Essay Question 19: The Characterisation and Description of Thalassemias

*Reference: Slides 19-21/VI*

### Introduction

Thalassemias are a group of inherited blood disorders characterized by reduced or absent production of normal hemoglobin chains. Unlike sickle cell anemia where the quality of hemoglobin is affected, thalassemias affect the quantity of hemoglobin produced. The name "thalassemia" derives from the Greek word "thalassa" (sea) and "haima" (blood), reflecting its high prevalence in Mediterranean populations.

### Hemoglobin Structure and Globin Chains

Hemoglobin consists of different globin chains that can be affected by thalassemic mutations:

| Globin Chain | Thalassemia Involvement |
|--------------|-------------------------|
| α (alpha) | Common - α-thalassemias |
| β (beta) | Common - β-thalassemias |
| γ (gamma) | Rare (only 3% of adult Hb) |
| δ (delta) | Rare (only 3% of adult Hb) |
| ε (epsilon) | No known thalassemic disorder |

### Genetic Basis

**Gene Loci:**
- **β-globin chain**: Encoded by 2 loci (one allele on each chromosome 11)
- **α-globin chain**: Encoded by 4 loci (HBA1 and HBA2 genes on chromosome 16, providing 4 alleles total)

**Population Prevalence:**
The deletion of one or more α-globin loci has a high prevalence among people of African and Asian descent.

---

### α-Thalassemias

In α-thalassemia, reduced α-chain production leads to an excess of β-chains in adults and γ-chains in newborns. The severity of anemia depends directly on the number of mutated or deleted alleles.

#### Clinical Manifestations by Allele Number

| Mutant Alleles | Genotype | Clinical Presentation |
|----------------|----------|----------------------|
| 1 mutant allele | -/α, α/α | **Silent carriers** - no clinical symptoms |
| 2 mutant alleles | -/-, α/α or -/α, -/α | **Mild microcytic hypochromic anemia** - red blood cells are smaller and paler than normal |
| 3 mutant alleles | -/-, -/α | **Hemoglobin H disease** - HbH (4β) and Hb Barts (4γ) present; Heinz bodies (precipitated HbH); anemia with splenomegaly |
| 4 mutant alleles | -/-, -/- | **Hydrops fetalis** - incompatible with life outside the uterus; one or more fetal compartments filled with fluid |

#### Abnormal Hemoglobin Forms in α-Thalassemia

**Hemoglobin H (HbH):**
- Consists of 4 β-chains (β₄)
- Forms unstable tetramers
- Has abnormal oxygen dissociation curves
- Precipitates in red blood cells forming Heinz bodies

**Hemoglobin Barts (Hb Barts):**
- Consists of 4 γ-chains (γ₄)
- Found in fetuses and newborns with severe α-thalassemia
- Causes intrauterine fetal death or severe neonatal disease

---

### β-Thalassemias

β-thalassemias result from mutations in the β-globin gene. The mutations are classified based on their effect on β-chain production:

**Mutation Types:**
- **β⁰ (beta-zero)**: No β-chain is produced
- **β⁺ (beta-plus)**: Some β-chain is produced, but in reduced amounts

#### Clinical Classification of β-Thalassemia

| Classification | Genotype | Clinical Features |
|----------------|----------|-------------------|
| **Thalassemia Minor** | β⁺/β or β⁰/β | Microcytic anemia (mild); carriers usually asymptomatic or mildly affected |
| **Thalassemia Intermedia** | β⁺/β⁺ or β⁰/β | Can manage a normal life; may need occasional transfusions during illness or pregnancy |
| **Thalassemia Major** | β⁺/β⁰ or β⁰/β⁰ or β⁺/β⁺ | Severe microcytic hypochromic anemia; splenomegaly; severe bone deformities; death mostly before age 20 without treatment |

### Clinical Significance

**Most Common Form:** α-thalassemias are the most common form of thalassemias globally, particularly in populations where malaria is or was endemic (protective heterozygote advantage).

**Iron Metabolism Connection:** Hepcidin deficiency plays a central role in the iron burden observed in thalassemias. The ineffective erythropoiesis in thalassemia suppresses hepcidin production, leading to increased intestinal iron absorption and iron overload even without transfusions.

### Conclusion

Thalassemias represent a spectrum of hemoglobin disorders where the quantity of globin chains is affected rather than their quality. The severity ranges from silent carrier states to conditions incompatible with life, depending on the number of affected alleles. Understanding the genetic basis of these conditions is essential for genetic counseling, prenatal diagnosis, and management of affected individuals.

## Essay Question 20: The Characterisation and Main Types of Stem Cells

*Reference: Slides 22-29/VI*

### Introduction

Stem cells are undifferentiated cells with the remarkable potential to develop into many different cell types during early life and growth. They serve as an internal repair system in many tissues, dividing essentially without limit to replenish other cells throughout the organism's life.

### Three Criteria for Stemness

The stem cell has three specific properties that are also criteria for stemness:

1. **Not terminally differentiated**: Stem cells are never the last stage of differentiation; they can give rise to more specialized cells.

2. **Unlimited division capacity**: They are able to divide virtually unlimitedly throughout the life of the organism.

3. **Dual daughter cell fate**: At division, each daughter cell has the ability to either remain a stem cell (self-renewal) or evolve into another cell type with a more specialized function (differentiation).

### Stem Cell Behavior in Different Tissues

Stem cells exhibit different division patterns depending on the tissue:

| Tissue Type | Division Pattern | Examples |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| High-turnover tissues | Regular division to replace worn/damaged cells | Gut, bone marrow |
| Low-turnover tissues | Division only under special conditions | Pancreas, heart |

---

### Classification by Developmental Potential

#### 1. Totipotent Stem Cells

**Definition:** Cells capable of giving rise to all cell types of the body plus all cell types that make up the extraembryonic tissues (such as the placenta, which is normally formed from trophoblasts).

**Occurrence:** Only the zygote and early morula cells are totipotent.

#### 2. Pluripotent Stem Cells

**Definition:** Cells capable of giving rise to all of the various cell types of the body but unable to create tissues outside the embryo (such as the amnion, chorion, and other components of the placenta).

**Key Characteristics:**
- Pluripotency may persist even after prolonged culture
- Progeny of a single cell can generate derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm)
- Generate a teratoma after injection into an immunosuppressed mouse

**Important Note:** Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent, NOT totipotent.

#### 3. Multipotent Stem Cells

**Definition:** Cells capable of developing into more than one cell type of the body, but with more limited potential than pluripotent cells.

**Examples:** Mesenchymal, adipose-derived, endothelial, dental pulp stem cells, and hematopoietic stem cells.

#### 4. Unipotent Stem Cells

**Definition:** Cells that can only renew one type of tissue or cell type.

---

### Main Types of Stem Cells

#### Embryonic Stem Cells (ESCs)

**Source:** Primitive (undifferentiated) cells derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of a 5-day preimplantation embryo (blastocyst stage).

**Characteristics:**
- Capable of dividing without differentiating for a prolonged period in culture
- Known to develop into cells and tissues of all three primary germ layers
- Pluripotent (not totipotent)
- Can form teratomas when injected into immunosuppressed mice

**Teratoma Test:** Used to verify whether putative stem cells can establish a human embryonic stem cell line. The result is positive if the teratoma contains cells characteristic of all three germ layers (ecto-, meso-, and endoderm), determined using molecular and morphological markers.

#### Somatic (Adult) Stem Cells (ASCs)

**Definition:** Relatively rare, undifferentiated cells found in many organs and differentiated tissues.

**Characteristics:**
- Limited capacity for self-renewal (in laboratory conditions)
- Limited capacity for differentiation
- Differentiation capacity usually restricted to cell types in the organ of origin
- May differentiate into other cell types in small proportions

**Types Isolated:**
- Hematopoietic stem cells
- Mammary stem cells
- Mesenchymal stem cells
- Endothelial stem cells
- Neural stem cells
- Olfactory stem cells
- Neural crest stem cells
- Testicular stem cells

#### Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs)

**Source:** Cells from immature embryonic connective tissue.

**Differentiation Potential:** Can give rise to:
- Chondrocytes (cartilage-forming cells)
- Osteoblasts (bone-forming cells)
- Adipocytes (fat cells)

#### Umbilical Cord Blood Stem Cells

**Characteristics:**
- Hematopoietic (can produce all blood cells in the body)
- Collected from umbilical cord blood at birth
- Currently used to replace damaged bone marrow function

**Clinical Applications:**
- Patients who have undergone chemotherapy for cancer
- Other blood-related disorders

#### Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs)

**Definition:** Reprogrammed somatic (adult) cells that have entered an embryonic stem cell-like state by being forced to express factors important for maintaining "stemness."

**Discovery:**
- Mouse iPSCs first reported in 2006 (Takahashi and Yamanaka)
- Human iPSCs first reported in late 2007 (Takahashi et al. and Yu et al.)

**Induction Methods:**

| Generation | Method | Advantage |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| First | Viral transfection of transcription factors (Oct3/4, Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc) | Established proof of concept |
| Later | Recombinant proteins and organic molecules (e.g., valproic acid, an HDAC inhibitor) | Reduced risk of genome integration and tumor formation |
| Current | Expression of microRNAs from plasmids | Lower tumorigenicity |

**Key Properties:**
- Express stem cell markers
- Form tumors containing cells from all three germ layers
- Can contribute to many different tissues when injected into mouse blastocysts

### Requirements for Stem Cell Transplantation

For transplant purposes, stem cells must reproducibly:

1. **Proliferate extensively** and generate sufficient quantities of tissue
2. **Differentiate** into the desired cell type(s)
3. **Survive** in the recipient after transplant
4. **Integrate** into the surrounding tissue after transplant
5. **Function appropriately** for the duration of the recipient's life
6. **Avoid harming** the recipient in any way

### Clinical Applications

**Currently Used Treatments:**
Blood-forming stem cells (hematopoietic stem cells) from bone marrow have been used for decades to treat:
- Leukemias and lymphomas
- Multiple myeloma
- Severe aplastic anemia and other marrow failure states
- Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID)
- Hemoglobinopathies

**Experimental Applications:**
Cardiac muscle regeneration experiments have shown:
- Stem cells injected into circulation or directly into damaged myocardium can improve cardiac function
- Can lead to formation of new capillaries
- Mechanism of improvement remains controversial
- More research needed to assess safety and efficacy

### Conclusion

Stem cells represent a diverse group of cells with varying potentials for differentiation and self-renewal. From totipotent cells capable of generating an entire organism to unipotent cells restricted to single tissue types, each class has unique biological properties and clinical applications. The development of iPSC technology has revolutionized regenerative medicine by providing patient-specific pluripotent cells without the ethical concerns associated with embryonic stem cells.

## Essay Question 21: The Criteria and Description of Cancer Cell Identity

*Reference: Slides 20-21/VII*

### Introduction

Cancer is characterized by uncontrolled cell growth and the ability to invade other tissues. Cancer cells differ fundamentally from normal cells through a combination of acquired characteristics that allow them to escape the normal regulatory mechanisms that govern cell division, death, and tissue boundaries.

### The Six Characteristics of Cancer Cells

Taking the essential properties of malignant cells as criteria, the characteristics of a cancer cell can be summarized in six points:

#### 1. Disregard of Growth Signals

Cancer cells **ignore external and internal signals that regulate cell proliferation**. They have:
- Tumor suppressor mutations that fail to detect growth inhibitors
- Oncogenic mutations that stimulate the cell cycle independently of external signals

**Analogy:** Like a car with a stuck accelerator pedal, causing the cell to continually grow and divide.

#### 2. Evasion of Apoptosis

Cancer cells **tend to avoid suicide by apoptosis**. However, this does not mean that cancer cells are completely unable to undergo apoptosis—they simply have a reduced tendency to do so when appropriate signals are present.

#### 3. Escape from Programmed Limitations

Cancer cells **circumvent programmed limitations to proliferation**. They:
- Escape replicative senescence (the normal limit on cell divisions)
- Avoid normal tissue differentiation
- Cross the programmed limits of cell division

#### 4. Genetic Instability

Cancer cells are **genetically unstable**. They:
- Constantly change their gene pool
- Take advantage of new mutations
- Accumulate additional genetic alterations over time

#### 5. Invasiveness

Cancer cells **escape from their home tissues** (are invasive). To achieve this, they:
- Support angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels)
- Break through intermediate tissue boundaries
- Migrate into surrounding tissues (invasion)

#### 6. Metastatic Ability

Cancer cells **survive and proliferate in foreign sites** (metastasize). This involves:
- Entering the bloodstream and lymphatic system
- Surviving circulation
- Penetrating normal tissues of distant body sites
- Colonizing and gradually taking control of the new tissue for their own growth

### Two Main Types of Cancer-Forming Mutations

| Mutation Type | Normal Function | Effect of Mutation | Inheritance Pattern |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Tumor Suppressor** | Acts as a brake on the cell cycle | Loss-of-function mutation; leads to tumor growth in homozygous form | Recessive (usually requires both alleles to be mutated) |
| **Oncogene** | Derived from proto-oncogene; involved in cell growth | Gain-of-function mutation; single allele mutation is sufficient | Dominant |

**Important Exception:** If a tumor suppressor acts in a multimeric form, a single monomer mutation may behave as a gain of function mutation. In this case, a homozygous mutation is not a prerequisite because the genetic defect of one allele is sufficient (e.g., some p53 mutations show this trait).

### The Process of Cancer Development

Cancer begins with the accumulation of mutations in the cell:

```
Mutation inactivates tumor suppressor gene
            ↓
Cells proliferate abnormally
            ↓
Mutations inactivate DNA repair genes
            ↓
Proto-oncogenes mutate to oncogenes
            ↓
More mutations, more genetic instability
            ↓
Malignant, metastatic disease
```

**Example - Colon Cancer:**
1. Begins with a defect in a tumor suppressor gene
2. Allows excessive cell proliferation
3. Proliferating cells acquire additional mutations (DNA repair genes, other tumor suppressors, proto-oncogenes)
4. Over time, accumulated mutations yield a highly malignant, metastatic tumor

**Key Concept:** Creating a cancer cell requires that:
- The brakes on cell growth (tumor suppressor genes) be released
- The accelerators for cell growth (oncogenes) be activated

### Loss of Heterozygosity (LOH)

**Definition:** The loss of normal function of one allele of a gene in which the other allele was already inactivated.

**Mechanism:**
1. First, an inactivating mutation in one allele of a tumor suppressor gene occurs in the parent's germline cell
2. Loss of heterozygosity occurs when the remaining functional allele in a somatic cell of the offspring becomes inactivated by mutation

**Clinical Example - Deleted in Colon Carcinoma (DCC):**
- LOH on chromosome 18 observed in:
  - 73% of colorectal carcinomas
  - 47% of advanced adenomas
  - 11-13% of earlier-stage adenomas
- The deleted region contains two tumor suppressor genes: DPC (SMAD4) and DCC

### Key Regulatory Proteins

#### p53 - Guardian of the Genome

**Functions:**
- Controls G1/S transition
- Expressed when DNA is damaged
- Inhibits oncogenic transformation
- Regulates the expression of mdm2 gene (self-regulatory negative feedback)

**Dual Effect:**
- Low levels: Inhibits entry into S and M phases, allows DNA repair
- Persistently high levels: Stimulates expression of Bax and Apaf1, leading to apoptotic cell death

**Clinical Significance:**
Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) results from inherited mutant alleles of p53, greatly increasing the likelihood of developing sarcoma, breast cancer, acute leukemia, and brain tumors.

### Cancer Stem Cells

**Definition:** Cancer cells that possess characteristics associated with normal stem cells, specifically the ability to give rise to all cell types found in a particular cancer sample.

**Current Status:**
- The existence of cancer stem cells remains a subject of debate in medical research
- Many studies have not successfully discovered the similarities and differences between normal tissue stem cells and cancer stem cells
- Existence has been shown only in animal models
- Animal models, especially in longevity, differ significantly from humans

### Cancer Nomenclature

Different types of cancers are distinguished by Latin prefixes referring to their anatomical location:

| Prefix/Type | Origin | Example |
|-------------|--------|---------|
| Carcinoma | Epithelial cells | Breast adenocarcinoma |
| Sarcoma | Connective tissue | Osteosarcoma (bone) |
| Lymphoma | Lymphatic tissue | Hodgkin lymphoma |
| Leukemia | Blood cells | Acute myeloid leukemia |

### Conclusion

Cancer cell identity is defined by six key characteristics that distinguish malignant cells from normal cells: disregard of growth signals, evasion of apoptosis, escape from replicative limits, genetic instability, invasiveness, and metastatic ability. These properties arise from accumulated mutations in tumor suppressors (acting as brakes) and oncogenes (acting as accelerators). Understanding these criteria is essential for cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and the development of targeted therapies.

## Essay Question 22: The Molecular Background of VHL Syndrome

*Reference: Slide 32/VII*

### Introduction

Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) syndrome is a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by mutations in the VHL tumor suppressor gene. The syndrome is characterized by the development of multiple tumors, particularly those associated with abnormal blood vessel growth (angiogenesis).

### Genetic Basis

**Inheritance Pattern:**
- VHL syndrome follows the classic "two-hit hypothesis" for tumor suppressor genes
- In most cases, affected individuals inherit one mutant copy of the VHL gene from a parent (first hit)
- The other mutation occurs somatically during the person's lifetime (second hit)

**Gene Location:** The VHL gene is located on chromosome 3p25-26.

### Function of the VHL Protein (pVHL)

The VHL protein is a critical component of the cellular oxygen-sensing system and plays multiple roles in regulating cell growth and angiogenesis.

#### Primary Function: Ubiquitin Ligase Activity

**pVHL as Part of Ubiquitin Ligase Complex:**
The VHL protein (pVHL) is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex responsible for:

1. **HIF1α Degradation:**
   - Targets the α subunit of HIF1 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1) for ubiquitination
   - HIF1α is a transcription factor that normally activates genes in response to low oxygen conditions
   - Under normal oxygen conditions, pVHL promotes HIF1α degradation

2. **Cyclin Degradation:**
   - pVHL is also involved in the degradation of cyclins
   - This contributes to cell cycle regulation

### Molecular Mechanism

```
Normal Oxygen Conditions (Normoxia):
                              
HIF1α (hydroxylated) → pVHL recognition → Ubiquitination → Proteasomal degradation
                                         ↓
                              Low VEGF expression
                              Normal angiogenesis

Low Oxygen Conditions (Hypoxia) OR pVHL Deficiency:
                              
HIF1α (not hydroxylated) → Escapes pVHL → Accumulates → Nuclear translocation
                                                        ↓
                                              High VEGF expression
                                              Excessive angiogenesis
                                              Tumor growth
```

### HIF1 and VEGF Pathway

**HIF1 (Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1):**
- A transcription factor activated under low oxygen conditions
- Regulates the expression of genes involved in:
  - Angiogenesis
  - Erythropoiesis
  - Glucose metabolism
  - Cell survival

**VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor):**
- Primary target gene of HIF1
- Promotes angiogenesis (formation of new blood vessels)
- Essential for tumor growth and spread
- When pVHL is defective, VEGF levels increase, supporting tumor vascularization

### Clinical Manifestations

When pVHL is defective, the continuous accumulation of HIF1α leads to persistent VEGF expression and excessive angiogenesis, resulting in characteristic tumors:

| Tumor Type | Location | Features |
|------------|----------|----------|
| **Renal Cell Carcinoma** | Kidneys | Most common cause of death in VHL; clear cell type |
| **Retinal Angiomas** | Eyes (retina) | Hemangioblastomas; can cause vision loss |
| **Cerebellar Hemangioblastomas** | Brain (cerebellum) | Benign but can cause neurological symptoms |
| **Pheochromocytomas** | Adrenal glands | Catecholamine-secreting tumors; cause hypertension |

**Additional Features:**
- Multiple cysts in kidneys, pancreas, and other organs
- Endolymphatic sac tumors (inner ear)
- Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors

### Connection to Other Tumor Suppressors

VHL syndrome demonstrates key principles of tumor suppressor function:

1. **Two-Hit Hypothesis:** Requires inactivation of both alleles for tumor formation
2. **Tissue Specificity:** Despite being expressed in many tissues, tumors develop in specific locations
3. **Angiogenesis Connection:** Highlights the critical role of blood vessel formation in tumor development

### Therapeutic Implications

Understanding the VHL-HIF-VEGF pathway has led to targeted therapeutic approaches:

1. **Anti-VEGF Therapies:**
   - Bevacizumab (anti-VEGF antibody)
   - Used in VHL-associated renal cell carcinoma

2. **HIF2α Inhibitors:**
   - Belzutifan (recently approved)
   - Directly targets the HIF pathway

3. **Surveillance Protocols:**
   - Regular screening for tumor development
   - Early intervention to prevent complications

### Summary: VHL Molecular Pathway

```
VHL Gene Mutation (Inherited or Somatic)
                ↓
Loss of pVHL Function
                ↓
Failure to Ubiquitinate HIF1α
                ↓
HIF1α Accumulation and Nuclear Translocation
                ↓
Increased VEGF Transcription
                ↓
Excessive Angiogenesis
                ↓
Tumor Development:
• Renal cell carcinoma
• Retinal angiomas
• Cerebellar hemangioblastomas
• Pheochromocytomas
```

### Conclusion

Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome exemplifies how dysfunction of the ubiquitin-proteasome system can lead to cancer. The VHL protein normally serves as a critical oxygen sensor by targeting HIF1α for degradation. When pVHL is defective, the resulting accumulation of HIF1α and subsequent overexpression of VEGF drives the formation of highly vascularized tumors characteristic of the syndrome. Understanding this molecular pathway has not only explained the disease mechanism but has also led to the development of targeted therapies that specifically address the underlying molecular defects.
