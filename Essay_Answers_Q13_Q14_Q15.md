## Essay Question 13: The Suggested Molecular Background of Down Syndrome

*Reference: Slides 26-/IV*

### Introduction

Down syndrome (also known as trisomy 21 or formerly "mongolism") is a congenital disorder caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 21 or a piece of chromosome 21. This chromosomal abnormality results in a total of 47 chromosomes rather than the normal 46. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying Down syndrome provides insight into how gene dosage effects can lead to complex phenotypic manifestations.

### Epidemiology and Genetics

**Incidence**: Approximately 1:740 live births (mean)

**Risk Factors**:
- The risk varies significantly with maternal age
- Incidence among offspring of young mothers: 1:1000
- Incidence among offspring of women over 40: 1:100 to 1:30
- Parents who have already had one child with Down syndrome have approximately 1% chance of having another affected child

**Three Genetic Forms**:

1. **Mosaic Down Syndrome**: A rare form in which only some cells contain a third copy of chromosome 21
2. **Trisomy 21**: The most common form where most cells contain three complete copies of chromosome 21
3. **Translocation (Partial Trisomy)**: The extra chromosome breaks and translocates to another chromosome; only this translocation is inherited into offspring

### Diagnosis

- Ultrasound and blood tests screen for the condition between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation
- Confirmation through amniocentesis (obtaining fetal fluid) or chorionic biopsy
- Fetal cells from amniotic fluid or maternal placenta are analyzed for chromosomal abnormalities
- These invasive procedures carry increased risk of delivery failure
- Preimplantation genetic diagnosis is available for carrier couples

### Clinical Features

**Physical Signs**:
- Small head
- Flat face
- Short neck
- Drawn (slanted) eyes
- Low-seated ears
- Large tongue
- Flabby skin under the chin

**Note**: The term "syndrome" indicates that symptoms do not always occur together in every patient.

**Other Features**:
- Poor muscle tone
- Abnormal heart and kidney development (one or both organs)
- Abnormal patterns of skin folds in palms, hands, and feet
- Intellectual disability (mild to moderate) typically occurs in all persons with Down syndrome

### Molecular Mechanisms

The molecular background of Down syndrome is complex and involves multiple pathways. The key mechanisms involve gene dosage effects from the translocated region of chromosome 21.

#### 1. The NFAT-Calcineurin Pathway

**Central Mechanism**:
Down syndrome can be caused by abnormal regulation of the intracellular location of NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells). NFAT is a transcription factor important for the regulation of many genes, including:
- Pro-inflammatory genes
- Pro-angiogenic genes

**Regulatory Proteins**:
NFAT is controlled by two key proteins, both encoded on chromosome 21:

1. **DSCR1 (Down Syndrome Critical Region 1)**:
   - Functions as an inhibitor of calcineurin
   - Calcineurin is a central serine-threonine phosphatase

2. **DYRK1A (Dual-Specificity Tyrosine Phosphorylation-Regulated Kinase 1A)**:
   - A serine-threonine kinase
   - Phosphorylates NFAT to keep it in the cytoplasm

**Pathological Effect**:
- In Down syndrome, levels of DSCR1 and DYRK1A are approximately 1.5-fold higher than normal (due to gene dosage effect from trisomy)
- This keeps NFAT in the cytoplasm rather than allowing it to translocate to the nucleus
- Results in **low levels of nuclear NFAT**
- Disrupts normal gene expression patterns

**VEGF Connection**:
The calcineurin-NFAT signaling pathway plays an important role in validating the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Disruption of this pathway affects angiogenesis and may contribute to cardiovascular abnormalities seen in Down syndrome.

**Clinical Relevance**:
The importance of the TGFβ pathway dysregulation was confirmed through comparison with Loeys-Dietz syndrome, which involves the TGFβR2 gene (a TGFβ receptor protein).

#### 2. APP (Amyloid Precursor Protein) Pathway

**Description**:
APP is an amyloid beta A4 precursor protein encoded on chromosome 21, suspected to play a major role in cognitive difficulties.

**Characteristics**:
- Integral membrane protein expressed in many tissues
- Concentrated in the synapses of neurons
- Primary function is not fully known but implicated in:
  - Synapse formation
  - Neural plasticity
  - Iron transport/export

**Beta Amyloid Formation**:
- APP is the precursor molecule for beta amyloid (Aβ)
- Aβ is a 39-42 amino acid peptide
- The fibrillar form is the primary component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease patients
- The coiled coil E2 domain resembles spectrin structure and binds heparan sulfate proteoglycans

**Pathological Implications**:
- Emerging consensus implicates prefibrillar intermediates (rather than mature amyloid fibrils) in causing cell death
- Cell death mechanisms involve:
  - Reactive oxygen species (ROS)
  - Mitochondrial defects
  - Apoptosis
- This may explain the early-onset Alzheimer's-like dementia seen in many Down syndrome patients

#### 3. ETS2 Pathway

**Description**:
ETS2 (Avian Erythroblastosis Virus E26 Oncogene Homolog 2) is encoded in the translocated region of chromosome 21.

**Functions and Abnormalities**:
- May play a role in apoptosis
- Associated with thymus abnormalities
- Associated with lymphocyte abnormalities

#### 4. MicroRNA Dysregulation

**Mechanism**:
MicroRNAs are also expressed from the chromosome 21 region. These are small endogenous non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression.

**Processing Pathway**:
- Primary miRNA (pri-miR) is transcribed from DNA in the nucleus
- Processed by Drosha/DGCR8 complex
- Exported by exportin 5
- Processed by dicer complex to mature miRNA
- Forms RISC/Ago2 complex to regulate target mRNAs

**Effects in Down Syndrome**:
Overexpression of certain microRNAs may result in aberrantly low levels of:
- **MeCP2 (Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2)**: Important for neural development
- **CREB1 (cAMP Response Element Binding Protein 1)**: Important for cognitive functions
- **MEF2C**: Transcription factor involved in neural development

#### 5. CREB1 and Cognitive Functions

**CREB1 Function**:
- Binds the cAMP response element (CRE), a DNA sequence on many promoters
- Stimulates transcription
- Resides in the nucleus in both active and inactive states
- Influences "immediate early responsive" genes
- Belongs to the leucine zipper family of DNA-binding proteins
- Forms homodimers to bind DNA
- Phosphorylated by several protein kinases in response to hormonal stimulation

**Role in Learning and Memory**:
- CREB is important for cognitive functions
- Essential for "long-term potentiation" (LTP), which plays a critical role in learning
- Low CREB levels contribute to cognitive difficulties in Down syndrome

**CREB Binding Protein (CBP)**:
- Interacts directly with Huntingtin protein (relevant in Huntington's disease)
- In Huntington's disease, CBP gets pulled away from its typical nuclear location

### Rett Syndrome Connection

Rett syndrome shares some features with Down syndrome and helps illustrate the importance of MeCP2:
- Incidence: 1:10,000 live births, mainly in girls
- Caused by mutations in or associated with the MECP2 gene
- Results in decreased speech and motor functions beginning 6-12 months after birth
- Followed by seizures, growth retardation, and cognitive impairment
- X-linked dominant disease affecting primarily the paternal X chromosome

### Summary of Defects in Down Syndrome

Multiple choice examination points indicate that defects may include:
- Low levels of nuclear NFAT
- Low levels of amyloid precursor
- Low levels of CREB and MeCP2
- Aberrant levels of certain microRNAs

### Conclusion

The molecular background of Down syndrome involves complex interactions between multiple gene products whose expression is increased due to trisomy 21. The primary mechanisms include: (1) dysregulation of the NFAT-calcineurin pathway through elevated DSCR1 and DYRK1A levels, (2) overexpression of APP leading to cognitive difficulties and early Alzheimer's-like pathology, (3) abnormal ETS2 expression affecting apoptosis and immune function, and (4) microRNA dysregulation leading to reduced levels of crucial transcription factors like CREB and proteins like MeCP2. Understanding these pathways provides potential therapeutic targets and explains the diverse clinical manifestations of this syndrome.

## Essay Question 14: The Molecular Background of Cystic Fibrosis

*Reference: Slides 19-/V*

### Introduction

Cystic fibrosis (CF), also known as mucoviscidosis, is a common autosomal recessive genetic disease that affects the entire body. The name refers to the characteristic scarring (fibrosis) and cyst formation within the pancreas. CF causes progressive disability and often leads to early death, with the highest incidence occurring in Ireland (approximately 3:10,000).

### Genetic Basis

**Causative Gene**:
CF is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the **CFTR (Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator)** protein.

**Allele Frequency by Population**:
- Caucasians (Europe, North Africa, Horn of Africa, Western Asia/Middle East, Central Asia, South Asia): 1 in 25 individuals carry a mutated allele
- Hispanic (Latino): 1 in 45
- Africans: 1 in 65
- East Asians: 1 in 90

**Most Common Mutation**:
The most common mutation is a deletion (Δ) of three nucleotides that results in the **loss of the amino acid phenylalanine (F) at position 508** on the protein. This mutation is designated as **ΔF508** (or F508del).

### The CFTR Protein

**Protein Classification**:
CFTR belongs to the **ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter** family.

**Function**:
- Functions as a halide anion channel
- Important in the secretion of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus
- Regulates chloride ion transport across epithelial cell membranes

**Structural Domains**:
1. **Two Nucleotide Binding Domains (NBD1 and NBD2)**: Bind and hydrolyze ATP
2. **Two Transmembrane Domains**: Form the chloride channel pore
3. **Regulatory (R) Domain**: Contains phosphorylation sites
4. **Carbohydrate**: Glycosylation sites on the extracellular surface

**Localization**:
- Expressed only at the apical membrane of ciliated cells
- Not expressed in goblet cells
- In bronchial epithelium: found on ciliated cells surrounding goblet cells

**The ΔF508 Mutation Site**:
- Located near the first nucleotide binding domain
- Results in misfolded protein that is degraded before reaching the cell membrane
- Even if it reaches the membrane, channel function is impaired

### Clinical Manifestations

Cystic fibrosis affects multiple organ systems:

**General Symptoms**:
- Growth failure (malabsorption)
- Vitamin deficiency states (vitamins A, D, E, K)
- Salty-tasting skin (due to abnormal sweat secretion)

**Lungs**:
- Bronchiectasis
- Bronchitis and bronchiolitis
- Pneumonia
- Atelectasis
- Hemoptysis
- Pneumothorax
- Reactive airway disease
- Cor pulmonale
- Respiratory failure
- Mucoid impaction of the bronchi
- Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis

**Nose and Sinuses**:
- Nasal polyps
- Sinusitis

**Liver**:
- Hepatic steatosis
- Portal hypertension

**Gallbladder**:
- Biliary cirrhosis
- Neonatal obstructive jaundice
- Cholelithiasis

**Heart**:
- Right ventricular hypertrophy
- Pulmonary artery dilation

**Pancreas**:
- Pancreatitis
- Insulin deficiency
- Symptomatic hyperglycemia
- Diabetes

**Intestines**:
- Meconium ileus (often presenting symptom in newborns)
- Meconium peritonitis
- Rectal prolapse
- Intussusception
- Volvulus
- Fibrosing colonopathy (strictures)
- Appendicitis
- Intestinal atresia
- Distal intestinal obstruction syndrome
- Inguinal hernia

**Reproductive System**:
- Infertility in males (aspermia, absence of vas deferens)
- Amenorrhea
- Delayed puberty

**Bone**:
- Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy
- Clubbing
- Arthritis
- Osteoporosis

**Stomach**:
- GERD (Gastroesophageal reflux disease)

**Spleen**:
- Hypersplenism

### Diagnosis and Treatment

**Diagnostic Methods**:
- Historically: Tasting newborn's sweat (salty taste)
- Current: Genetic testing (definitive)
- Recommended: Preimplantation genetic diagnosis for couples who are known carriers

**Treatment Goals**:
The most important aspect of therapy is to protect the lungs from massive secretions and infection for better quality of life.

**Treatment Complications**:
Treatment is complicated by associated conditions:
- Diabetes (due to loss of pancreatic islet cells)
- Osteoporosis (due to limited uptake of vitamin D)

**Therapeutic Agents**:
1. **Antibiotics**: To combat recurrent infections
2. **Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme)**: A recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I that breaks down DNA in sputum, thereby decreasing its viscosity
3. **Hypertonic saline**: Helps clear mucus

**Prognosis**:
Life expectancy for CF patients in the U.S. and Canada has increased dramatically over the last 70 years—from a few months to 30-50 years.

### Theories Explaining the Persistence of CF

Since CF is a recessive disease, the question arises: why has CF persisted in human populations? Several theories are based on **heterozygous advantage** (similar to sickle cell anemia):

1. **Cholera Resistance**: Suspected but not confirmed

2. **Typhoid Fever (Enteric Fever) Resistance**: More established evidence
   - *Salmonella typhi* requires the CFTR protein for cellular entry
   - Outside Europe (where CF is less common), typhoid fever is more prevalent
   - CF carriers may have partial protection against this infection

3. **Protection Against Lactose Intolerance**: Proposed but not well-established

4. **Tuberculosis Resistance**: Another proposed protective mechanism

### Molecular Pathophysiology

**Normal CFTR Function**:
- In normal epithelial cells, CFTR channels regulate chloride ion movement
- Water follows chloride ions, maintaining appropriate mucus hydration
- This creates thin, easily-cleared mucus in airways

**Mutant CFTR (ΔF508)**:
1. **Protein Misfolding**: The deletion causes the protein to misfold
2. **ER Retention**: Misfolded protein is retained in the endoplasmic reticulum
3. **Proteasomal Degradation**: The protein is targeted for degradation
4. **Channel Dysfunction**: Any protein that escapes degradation has impaired function
5. **Chloride Transport Defect**: Reduced chloride secretion
6. **Dehydrated Mucus**: Thick, sticky mucus accumulates
7. **Infection and Inflammation**: Mucus provides environment for bacterial growth

### Summary Table: CFTR and CF

| Aspect | Normal | Cystic Fibrosis |
|--------|--------|-----------------|
| Chloride transport | Normal | Impaired |
| Mucus viscosity | Low | High |
| Lung clearance | Effective | Impaired |
| Sweat chloride | Normal | Elevated |
| Pancreatic function | Normal | Often impaired |

### Examination Questions Related to CF

True statements about cystic fibrosis include:
- Caused by loss of Phe near the nucleotide binding domain (ΔF508)
- Life expectancy has improved over the last 70 years
- It is related to a transmembrane conductance regulator mutation

### Conclusion

Cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene, most commonly the ΔF508 deletion. CFTR normally functions as an ATP-binding cassette transporter and chloride channel essential for maintaining proper fluid secretion in multiple organ systems. The loss of CFTR function leads to thick, dehydrated mucus that causes progressive organ damage, particularly in the lungs and pancreas. Modern treatments have dramatically improved life expectancy, and the persistence of CF alleles in the population may be explained by heterozygous advantage against certain infectious diseases.

## Essay Question 15: The Molecular Defects in the Background of Marfan's Syndrome

*Reference: Slides 4-6/VI*

### Introduction

Marfan syndrome is a disorder of connective tissue that causes skeletal defects and affects multiple organ systems. The condition is typically recognized in tall, lanky individuals with characteristic physical features. Understanding the molecular basis of Marfan syndrome reveals important connections between extracellular matrix components and growth factor signaling.

### Clinical Features

**Skeletal Manifestations**:
- Tall stature with long limbs
- Spider-like fingers (arachnodactyly)
- Chest abnormalities (pectus excavatum—sunken chest, or pectus carinatum—protruding chest)
- Curvature of the spine (scoliosis, kyphosis)

**Facial Features**:
- Highly arched palate
- Crowded teeth
- Long, narrow face

**Cardiovascular Abnormalities** (Most Significant):
- Enlargement (dilatation) of the base of the aorta
- Risk of aortic dissection and rupture
- Mitral valve prolapse
- These cardiac manifestations are the primary cause of mortality

### Molecular Basis

**Gene Involved**:
Marfan syndrome is caused by mutations in the gene encoding **fibrillin-1**, a glycoprotein component of the extracellular matrix (ECM).

**Inheritance Pattern**:
- **Autosomal dominant**
- **Haploinsufficiency**: One copy of the mutated gene is sufficient to cause disease (one normal copy is not sufficient for normal function)

### Fibrillin-1 Protein

**Normal Functions**:
1. **Structural Role**: Essential for proper formation and maintenance of the extracellular matrix, including elastic fibers
2. **Growth Factor Regulation**: Serves as a reservoir for growth factors in the ECM

**ECM Importance**:
The extracellular matrix is critical for:
- Structural integrity of connective tissue
- Serving as a reservoir for growth factors
- Tissue homeostasis and repair

### The TGFβ Connection

**Key Molecular Mechanism**:
Fibrillin-1 directly binds a latent form of **TGFβ (Transforming Growth Factor Beta)**, keeping it sequestered and unable to exert its biological activity.

**Pathophysiological Model**:
The simplest model of Marfan syndrome suggests that:
1. Reduced levels of fibrillin-1 (due to mutation)
2. Inadequate sequestration of TGFβ
3. TGFβ levels rise in tissues
4. Excessive TGFβ signaling leads to tissue abnormalities

**TGFβ Effects**:
Elevated TGFβ activity can lead to:
- Abnormal elastic fiber development
- Weakening of the aortic wall
- Altered skeletal growth
- Connective tissue fragility

### Confirmation of TGFβ Pathway Importance

**Loeys-Dietz Syndrome**:
The importance of the TGFβ pathway in connective tissue disorders was confirmed with the discovery of **Loeys-Dietz syndrome**:
- Involves mutations in the **TGFβR2 gene** (encoding a TGFβ receptor protein)
- Produces similar clinical features to Marfan syndrome
- The two syndromes are often confused with each other

This discovery provided strong evidence that dysregulated TGFβ signaling is central to the pathophysiology of Marfan syndrome.

### Structural Consequences

**Elastic Fiber Abnormalities**:
- Fibrillin-1 is essential for elastic fiber formation
- Mutations lead to fragmented, disorganized elastic fibers
- Loss of tissue elasticity and resilience

**Aortic Wall Changes**:
- The aortic wall normally contains elastic fibers for compliance
- In Marfan syndrome, the aortic media becomes weakened
- Progressive dilatation of the aortic root occurs
- Risk of life-threatening aortic dissection

### Comparison: Marfan Syndrome vs. Loeys-Dietz Syndrome

| Feature | Marfan Syndrome | Loeys-Dietz Syndrome |
|---------|----------------|---------------------|
| Gene affected | FBN1 (Fibrillin-1) | TGFβR1 or TGFβR2 |
| Inheritance | Autosomal dominant | Autosomal dominant |
| Primary defect | Structural/sequestration | Receptor signaling |
| TGFβ pathway | Dysregulated (indirect) | Dysregulated (direct) |
| Skeletal features | Present | Present |
| Cardiovascular | Aortic dilatation | Aortic aneurysm, arterial tortuosity |
| Clinical overlap | Significant | Significant |

### Therapeutic Implications

Understanding the molecular mechanisms has therapeutic implications:

1. **Beta-Blockers**: Reduce hemodynamic stress on the aorta
2. **Losartan (Angiotensin Receptor Blocker)**: May reduce TGFβ signaling
3. **Surgical Intervention**: Prophylactic aortic root replacement may be necessary
4. **Regular Monitoring**: Echocardiographic surveillance for aortic dilatation

### Clinical Vignette: Spine Involvement

A case example from the course materials describes a 15-year-old boy with Marfan syndrome and severe lumbar scoliosis and kyphosis who was treated with anterior and posterior spinal fusion with instrumentation. Following surgery, he returned to full activity, demonstrating that skeletal complications can be successfully managed.

### Summary: Molecular Pathway in Marfan Syndrome

```
FBN1 Mutation
      ↓
Reduced Fibrillin-1 Production
      ↓
Defective ECM Assembly + Inadequate TGFβ Sequestration
      ↓
Elevated Free TGFβ Levels
      ↓
Excessive TGFβ Signaling
      ↓
• Abnormal Elastic Fiber Development
• Weakened Connective Tissue
• Aortic Dilatation
• Skeletal Abnormalities
```

### Conclusion

Marfan syndrome results from mutations in the fibrillin-1 gene, leading to both structural defects in the extracellular matrix and dysregulated TGFβ signaling. The protein's dual role—providing structural support to elastic fibers and sequestering latent TGFβ—explains the diverse clinical manifestations of the syndrome. The discovery of Loeys-Dietz syndrome, caused by mutations in TGFβ receptors, confirmed the central role of the TGFβ pathway. This molecular understanding has opened new therapeutic avenues, including the use of angiotensin receptor blockers to modulate TGFβ signaling, in addition to traditional surgical management of cardiovascular complications.
