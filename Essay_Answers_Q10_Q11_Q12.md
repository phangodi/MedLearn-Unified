## Essay Question 10: The Mechanism and Effects of ADP-Ribosylation

*Reference: Slides 24-26/III*

### Introduction

ADP-ribosylation is a post-translational modification of proteins in which ADP-ribose units are transferred from NAD⁺ to target proteins. This modification can occur as either mono-ADP-ribosylation (single unit) or poly-ADP-ribosylation (multiple units in chains). ADP-ribosylation plays crucial roles in signal transduction, DNA repair, apoptosis, and various pathological conditions including bacterial infections.

### Structure of ADP-Ribose

ADP-ribose consists of two ribose sugar molecules connected by a pyrophosphate group, attached to an adenine base. The molecule forms a glycosidic bond to target proteins at specific amino acid residues:

- **Arginine (Arg)**
- **Glutamate (Glu)**
- **Aspartate (Asp)**

The unique structure of ADP-ribose with two pyrophosphate-linked riboses likely represents a distinct signaling mechanism compared to single phosphate-linked ribose units found in RNA.

### Types of ADP-Ribosylation

#### Mono-ADP-Ribosylation

Mono-ADP-ribosylation involves the attachment of a single ADP-ribose unit to proteins. This modification is important in:

- Regulation of immunity
- Metabolic processes
- Signal transduction

The enzymes involved include:
- **Sirtuins (7 in humans)** - with deacetylase activity (Sirt1-3, Sirt5-7)
- **ADP-ribosyltransferases (ARTs, 4 in humans)** - including Sirt4
- **ADP-ribose hydrolases (ARHs)** - remove mono-ADP-ribose

#### Poly-ADP-Ribosylation

Poly-ADP-ribosylation involves the formation of long chains of ADP-ribose units. This modification is catalyzed by:

- **Poly-ADP-ribosyl polymerases (PARPs)** - 18 isoforms exist in humans
- **PARG (Poly-ADP-ribose glycohydrolase)** - removes poly-ADP-ribose chains

### The PARP Enzyme System

#### DNA Damage Detection and Repair

PARP plays a central role in DNA repair mechanisms:

1. **Detection of DNA damage**: PARP recognizes "single strand DNA breaks" in DNA
2. **DNA-binding domain**: Contains a Zn-finger motif that recognizes damaged DNA
3. **Organization of repair**: PARP recruits and organizes repair enzymes (DNA ligase, DNA polymerase, etc.)
4. **Poly-ADP-ribose chain formation**: During repair of extensive DNA damage, PARP generates long side chains of poly-ADP-ribose

#### Metabolic Consequences of PARP Overactivity

Excessive PARP activity creates metabolic problems due to NAD⁺ consumption:

**ATP Deficiency Mechanism:**
- PARP uses NAD⁺ as a substrate
- NAD⁺ depletion inhibits hexokinase (which regulates glucose uptake)
- PARP also inhibits GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase)
- GAPDH is the only NAD⁺-using enzyme in glycolysis
- This results in inhibited glucose oxidation
- Ultimately leads to cell lysis due to energy deficit

#### GAPDH - An Interesting Note

GAPDH has additional functions beyond glycolysis:
- Can translocate from cytoplasm to nucleus
- Interacts with telomerase RNA primer
- Inhibits telomerase function, thereby interfering with tumor cell survival

### Role in Apoptosis

Poly-ADP-ribosylation has important connections to apoptosis:

1. **AIF Release**: Accumulation of poly-ADP-ribose (PAR) stimulates the release of AIF (Apoptosis Inducing Factor) from mitochondria
2. **Apoptosis Initiation**: Released AIF generates apoptosis
3. **Caspase Cleavage**: Another domain of PARP can be inactivated by caspases, which is a mechanism initiated during apoptosis

#### Survival Mechanism in Embryonic Cells

An interesting protective mechanism exists in embryonic cells:
- When growth factor levels decline
- AIF is inactivated rather than activated
- This allows embryonic cells to survive rather than undergo apoptosis

### Role in Genomic Imprinting

ADP-ribosylation plays a role in epigenetic regulation:

**CTCF Protein Modification:**
- The CTCF protein is modified by ADP-ribosylation
- This modification allows methylation of CpG nucleotides
- Results in genomic imprinting
- Example: Expression of paternal IGF-2 allele but activation of the maternally inherited allele

### Bacterial Toxins and ADP-Ribosylation

Several bacterial toxins exert their pathological effects through ADP-ribosyl transferase activity:

| Toxin | Bacterium | Target | Effect |
|-------|-----------|--------|--------|
| **Cholera toxin** | *Vibrio cholerae* | G-proteins (ion channel regulators) | Massive fluid secretion in intestinal epithelial cells → diarrhea |
| **Diphtheria toxin** | *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* | Elongation factor 2 (EF-2) | Inhibition of protein synthesis |
| **Pertussis toxin** | *Bordetella pertussis* | G-proteins | Disruption of signaling pathways |

These toxins modify G-proteins by ADP-ribosylation, thereby affecting signaling pathways and their effectors (ion channels, enzymes), leading to disease symptoms.

### The Sirtuin Connection

**Sirtuins** are Silent Information Regulation genes, first discovered in yeast:

**Characteristics:**
- NAD⁺-dependent deacylase activity
- Mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase activity
- Dependence on NAD⁺ couples them to cellular energy metabolism

**NAD⁺ Coupling:**
- Absolute level of NAD⁺
- Nicotinamide levels
- NAD⁺/NADH ratio

**Human Sirtuins (7 types):**
- **Deacetylase activity**: Sirt1-3, Sirt5-7
- **ADP-ribosyltransferase activity**: Sirt4

**Functional Roles:**
- **Sirt1**: Metabolism
- **Sirt3**: Metabolism, mitochondrial function
- **Sirt4**: Mitochondrial function
- **Sirt5**: Mitochondrial function
- **Sirt6**: DNA repair

### Clinical Significance

ADP-ribosylation has significant clinical implications:

1. **Cancer Therapy**: PARP inhibitors are used in cancer treatment, particularly in BRCA-mutant tumors
2. **Infectious Diseases**: Understanding bacterial toxin mechanisms aids in treatment development
3. **Metabolic Disorders**: The connection between PARP and NAD⁺ metabolism relates to various metabolic conditions
4. **DNA Repair Deficiency Syndromes**: Abnormal ADP-ribosylation can contribute to genomic instability

### Conclusion

ADP-ribosylation represents a versatile post-translational modification with critical functions in cellular homeostasis. From detecting and repairing DNA damage to regulating metabolism and cell death, this modification involves complex enzymatic systems including PARPs and sirtuins. The exploitation of ADP-ribosylation mechanisms by bacterial toxins highlights the importance of this pathway in both health and disease. Understanding these mechanisms provides insights into developmental processes, disease pathogenesis, and potential therapeutic targets.

## Essay Question 11: Comparison of Abnormalities in Blastogenesis, Organogenesis, and Fetal Development

*Reference: Slides 15-/II; 7-/III; 6-/IV*

### Introduction

Human prenatal development can be divided into three major stages, each characterized by distinct developmental processes and, consequently, different types of abnormalities when development goes awry. Understanding these differences is crucial for comprehending the mechanisms and outcomes of congenital malformations.

### Overview of Developmental Stages

| Stage | Time Period | Primary Events |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Blastogenesis** | Days 0-28 | Formation of basic body plan, fate map determination |
| **Organogenesis** | Days 29-56 | Development and differentiation of organs |
| **Fetal Development (Phenogenesis)** | Days 57-266 | Growth, maturation, attainment of final form |

### Blastogenesis (Days 0-28)

#### Characteristics

During blastogenesis, the fundamental body plan is established:
- Formation of the blastocyst from rapid mitotic cell divisions
- Implantation and development of bilaminar disc
- Gastrulation and formation of three germ layers
- Establishment of body axes and fate map
- Close proximity of cells and developing structures
- Highly integrated and interdependent developmental processes

#### Nature of Abnormalities

Abnormalities in blastogenesis are characterized by:

1. **Severity**: Very severe deformities
2. **Extent**: Usually affect multiple parts of the body
3. **Prognosis**: Often lead to pre- or perinatal death
4. **Incidence**: Approximately 5% of embryos are affected

**Why are these defects so severe?**
- Small size of the early embryo
- Close proximity of organ rudiments
- Strongly integrated and interdependent nature of early development
- Disruption of one process affects many subsequent processes

#### Types of Blastogenesis Defects

- Gross brain abnormalities
- Facial clefts (severe)
- Eye defects
- Gross heart defects
- Laterality ("sidedness") defects
- Absence of limbs (amelia)
- Body wall defects

#### Example: Thalidomide-Induced Limb Deficiency (Amelia)

**Background:**
- Thalidomide was used to alleviate morning sickness in pregnancy
- Resulted in 10,000-20,000 births with limb deficiency and other defects worldwide
- More than 2,000 affected in West Germany alone

**Mechanism:**
- Thalidomide has two enantiomers (S and R forms) that convert to each other in vivo
- The (S) form is teratogenic; the (R) form alleviates nausea
- The (S) form intercalates into G-C rich DNA segments
- The glutarimide moiety fits into the major groove at purine nucleotides
- Inhibits IGF-1 and FGF-2 promoters (which stimulate angiogenesis)
- Affects development of limbs, ears, and eyes

**Molecular Target:**
- Thalidomide affects cereblon, an E3 ubiquitin ligase component
- The ubiquitin ligase complex (with DDB1) is important for limb and ear development
- Lack of cereblon in chick and zebrafish embryos shows thalidomide-like effects

**Timing:**
- Limb deficiency (amelia) occurs during weeks 3-5
- This overlaps with both blastogenesis and early organogenesis

### Organogenesis (Days 29-56)

#### Characteristics

During organogenesis:
- Development of most organ systems begins
- Differentiation of specialized tissues
- By the 7th week (9th gestational week), essential organs have begun to develop
- The elbow and fingers become distinguishable
- Lung development begins
- Heart beats can be expected

#### Nature of Abnormalities

Abnormalities in organogenesis are characterized by:

1. **Severity**: Relatively mild compared to blastogenesis defects
2. **Extent**: Affect only restricted parts of the body
3. **Prognosis**: Allow survival of the organism
4. **Mechanism**: Often involve specific genes controlling organ formation

#### Types of Organogenesis Defects

- Cleft palate
- Webbed fingers (syndactyly)
- Hypospadias (improper closure of male urethra)
- Extra finger (polydactyly)
- Specific organ malformations

#### Example: Syndactyly (Webbed Fingers)

**Definition:**
Syndactyly refers to the fusion of adjacent fingers or toes, presenting in two forms:
- **Cutaneous syndactyly**: Skin fusion only
- **Osseous/fibrous syndactyly**: Bone or fibrous tissue fusion

**Characteristics:**
- **Incidence**: 1:2,000 births
- **Cause**: Not fully known
- **Associations**: Frequently associated with rare syndromes (e.g., Down syndrome)

**Proposed Mechanism:**
- Suggested to result from lack of apoptosis between the developing fingers
- Normally, programmed cell death separates the digits during development
- Failure of this apoptotic process leads to persistent webbing

**Contributing Factors:**
- Studies connect this abnormality to maternal factors:
  - Maternal nutrition
  - Smoking during pregnancy

### Fetal Development / Phenogenesis (Days 57-266)

#### Characteristics

During fetal development:
- "Attainment of final form" (phenogenesis)
- Enormous growth of the fetus
- Maturation of function in every organ
- Cell type differentiation
- Acquisition of individual attributes

#### Nature of Abnormalities

Abnormalities in fetal development are characterized by:

1. **Severity**: Minor anomalies compared to embryonic defects
2. **Inheritance**: Variable - some strongly genetic, others largely environmental
3. **Prognosis**: Common in population; many allow normal life
4. **Discovery**: Some internal anomalies not discovered until autopsy or injury

**Genetic Complexity:**
- Often involve several or many genes inherited from both parents
- Referred to as "multifactorial" or "polygenic" inheritance
- Latest-developing malformations are rather common
- Many appear to be dominantly inherited

#### Types of Fetal Development Defects

- Minor internal anomalies (heart, brain)
- Size abnormalities
- Minor structural variations
- Functional maturation defects

#### Example: Achondroplasia

**Definition:**
Achondroplasia is the prototype of short-limbed dwarfism, representing the archetype of a group of disorders ranging from severe thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) to less severe hypochondroplasia.

**Clinical Features:**
- Short limbs proportionately shorter than trunk (abdominal area)
- Large head with characteristic facial features
- Protruding broad forehead (frontal bossing)
- Midfacial hypoplasia
- **Average height**: 131 cm (males) or 123 cm (females)

**Epidemiology:**
- **Incidence**: 1:40,000 to 1:15,000 births
- About 85% of cases are caused by sporadic mutation
- Associated with paternal age >35 years
- Can be inherited as autosomal dominant

**Molecular Mechanism:**
- Caused by mutation in the **FGFR3** (fibroblast growth factor receptor 3) gene
- **Penetrance**: High, close to 100%
- FGFR3 normally has a **negative regulatory effect** on bone growth
- The mutated receptor is **constitutively active**
- This leads to inhibition of cartilage growth and severely shortened bones

**Genetic Details:**
- 98% of mutations: G → A point mutation at nucleotide 1138
- 1% of mutations: G → C at the same position
- Affects the transmembrane domain of the receptor
- Studies show new mutations come exclusively from the father during spermatogenesis
- May provide selective advantage to the spermatocyte

**Homozygosity:**
- If both parents have achondroplasia
- Homozygous progeny will be **lethal** before or shortly after birth

### Comparative Summary

| Feature | Blastogenesis | Organogenesis | Fetal Development |
|---------|---------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Timing** | Days 0-28 | Days 29-56 | Days 57-266 |
| **Severity** | Very severe | Relatively mild | Minor |
| **Extent** | Multiple body parts | Restricted to specific organs | Often localized |
| **Prognosis** | Often lethal | Usually survivable | Usually compatible with life |
| **Example** | Amelia (thalidomide) | Syndactyly | Achondroplasia |
| **Mechanism Example** | Ubiquitin ligase disruption | Failed apoptosis | Constitutively active FGFR3 |

### Conclusion

The nature of developmental abnormalities is directly related to the stage of development at which they occur. Blastogenesis defects are the most severe because they disrupt the fundamental body plan when structures are closely integrated. Organogenesis defects are more localized but still significant. Fetal development abnormalities are generally milder, affecting growth and final form rather than basic structure. Understanding these differences is essential for prenatal diagnosis, genetic counseling, and understanding the mechanisms of congenital malformations.

## Essay Question 12: How Does Angiotensin Influence the Calcineurin-NFAT Pathway in Cardiac Hypertrophy?

*Reference: Slides 9-/IV*

### Introduction

Cardiac hypertrophy is an adaptive response of the heart to increased workload or pathological stimuli. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying cardiac hypertrophy is crucial because it represents a significant risk factor for heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Two main signaling pathways regulate cardiac hypertrophy: one leading to adaptive (physiological) hypertrophy and another leading to non-adaptive (pathological) hypertrophy. Angiotensin II plays a central role in the pathway leading to non-adaptive hypertrophy through the calcineurin-NFAT signaling cascade.

### Clinical Context: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy

Before discussing the molecular mechanisms, it's important to understand the clinical significance:

- **Most frequent cause of sudden cardiac death** among young athletes
- Often (50-60%) related to mutations in 1-9 sarcomeric genes
- 45% of mutations occur in the **β-myosin heavy chain** gene
- 35% involve the **cardiac myosin-binding protein C** gene
- The **deletion/deletion genotype of ACE** (angiotensin-converting enzyme) is associated with a more severe form of the disease

### The Two Main Pathways in Cardiac Hypertrophy

The heart responds to stress through two distinct pathways with different outcomes:

#### 1. Adaptive (Physiological) Hypertrophy Pathway

**Triggered by:** Growth factors (FGF, IGF, etc.)

**Receptor type:** Tyrosine Kinase Receptors

**Signaling cascade:**
```
FGF/IGF → Tyrosine Kinase Receptor → Shc/GRb2 → RAS → RAF → MEF → MAPK
                                                      ↓
                                           PI3K → PDK1 → AKT
```

**Outcome:** Adaptive hypertrophy - beneficial enlargement of the heart that maintains or improves cardiac function

#### 2. Non-Adaptive (Pathological) Hypertrophy Pathway

**Triggered by:** Angiotensin II (Ang II), Endothelin (Et), and other factors

**Receptor type:** Heptahelical (G-protein coupled) Receptors

**Signaling cascade:**
```
Ang II → Heptahelical Receptor → G-protein → PLC → DAG + IP3
                                                      ↓
                              Sarcoplasmic Reticulum ← IP3
                                                      ↓
                                                    Ca²⁺
                                                      ↓
                                              Calcineurin → NFAT
                                                      ↓
                                         PKC → GSK-3 / mTOR
```

**Outcome:** Non-adaptive hypertrophy - pathological enlargement that can lead to heart failure

### The Angiotensin II Signaling Pathway in Detail

#### Step 1: Receptor Activation

- **Angiotensin II** binds to its receptor (AT1 receptor, a heptahelical/GPCR)
- This activates the associated **G-protein**
- The activated G-protein stimulates **phospholipase C (PLC)**

#### Step 2: Second Messenger Generation

PLC cleaves phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) into two second messengers:

1. **Diacylglycerol (DAG)** - remains in the membrane
2. **Inositol trisphosphate (IP3)** - diffuses into the cytoplasm

#### Step 3: Calcium Release

- IP3 binds to receptors on the **sarcoplasmic reticulum**
- This triggers the release of **Ca²⁺** into the cytoplasm
- Elevated cytoplasmic calcium is the key signal for calcineurin activation

#### Step 4: Calcineurin Activation

**Calcineurin** (also known as protein phosphatase 2B or PP2B) is a central serine-threonine phosphatase in this pathway:

- Calcineurin is **calcium-dependent**
- When cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ rises, calcineurin becomes activated
- Calcineurin then dephosphorylates its targets, including NFAT

#### Step 5: NFAT Dephosphorylation and Nuclear Translocation

**NFAT (Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells)** is a transcription factor family:

- In the cytoplasm, NFAT exists in a **phosphorylated, inactive form (pNFAT)**
- When calcineurin is activated, it **dephosphorylates NFAT**
- Dephosphorylated NFAT (NFATc1) **translocates to the nucleus**

#### Step 6: Gene Transcription

In the nucleus, NFAT:
- Activates transcription of **hypertrophic genes**
- Promotes expression of pro-inflammatory genes
- Stimulates pro-angiogenic gene expression
- Induces genes that lead to pathological cardiac remodeling

### Parallel Signaling Branches

The angiotensin pathway also activates other important signaling molecules:

#### PKC (Protein Kinase C)
- Activated by DAG and calcium
- Contributes to hypertrophic signaling
- Can activate GSK-3 and mTOR pathways

#### GSK-3 (Glycogen Synthase Kinase-3)
- Inhibited by PKC activation
- When inhibited, allows hypertrophic gene expression
- Normally acts as a negative regulator of hypertrophy

#### mTOR (Mammalian Target of Rapamycin)
- Activated in the hypertrophic pathway
- Promotes protein synthesis and cell growth
- Contributes to cardiac myocyte enlargement

### The Role of ACE (Angiotensin Converting Enzyme)

ACE is crucial for generating Angiotensin II:

**Renin-Angiotensin System:**
```
Angiotensinogen → (Renin) → Angiotensin I → (ACE) → Angiotensin II
```

**Clinical Relevance:**
- The deletion/deletion (D/D) genotype of ACE is associated with higher ACE activity
- This leads to increased Angiotensin II production
- Results in **more severe forms of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy**
- This explains why ACE inhibitors are used therapeutically in cardiac disease

### Regulation of the Calcineurin-NFAT Pathway

#### DSCR1 (Down Syndrome Critical Region 1)

DSCR1 is an important regulatory protein:
- Functions as a **calcineurin inhibitor**
- When DSCR1 levels are elevated, calcineurin activity is suppressed
- NFAT remains phosphorylated and cytoplasmic
- Gene transcription driven by NFAT is reduced

#### DYRK1A

Another regulatory protein:
- **Dual-specificity tyrosine phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1A**
- A serine-threonine kinase
- Phosphorylates NFAT, keeping it in the cytoplasm
- Located on chromosome 21

#### Connection to Down Syndrome

Both DSCR1 and DYRK1A are encoded on chromosome 21:
- In Down syndrome (trisomy 21), these genes are overexpressed
- DSCR1 and DYRK1A levels are ~1.5 fold higher than normal
- This keeps NFAT in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus
- Results in **low levels of nuclear NFAT**
- May contribute to cardiac abnormalities seen in Down syndrome

                              ↓
                 NON-ADAPTIVE HYPERTROPHY
```

### Clinical Implications

Understanding the angiotensin-calcineurin-NFAT pathway has several clinical applications:

1. **ACE Inhibitors**: Block angiotensin II production, reducing pathological hypertrophy
2. **Angiotensin Receptor Blockers (ARBs)**: Block AT1 receptor, preventing pathway activation
3. **Calcineurin Inhibitors**: Used in transplant medicine (cyclosporine A inhibits calcineurin)
4. **Prognostic Value**: ACE genotype can predict disease severity

### Conclusion

Angiotensin II influences cardiac hypertrophy through a well-defined signaling pathway that culminates in the activation of calcineurin and subsequent nuclear translocation of NFAT transcription factors. This pathway is distinct from the growth factor-mediated adaptive hypertrophy pathway and leads to pathological cardiac remodeling. The calcineurin-NFAT pathway is regulated by inhibitory proteins like DSCR1 and DYRK1A. Understanding these mechanisms provides targets for therapeutic intervention in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and heart failure, explaining the clinical utility of ACE inhibitors and related drugs in cardiovascular medicine.
