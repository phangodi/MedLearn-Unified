    <h1>Health Experience &amp; Medicalisation Q&amp;A</h1>
    <p>Exploring concepts of health, illness behaviour and the impact of medicalisation</p>
  </div>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>Ask around and write down the first concept that comes to people’s minds about health. How many different concepts do we get?</h2>
    <p>When people are asked what “health” means to them, the answers vary widely. Some equate health with the <strong>absence of disease</strong>, while others emphasise <strong>physical functioning</strong>—the ability to carry out daily tasks without pain or fatigue. Many mention <strong>mental well‑being</strong>, such as emotional stability and freedom from stress, or <strong>social well‑being</strong>, meaning supportive relationships and community. Others focus on <strong>healthy lifestyle</strong> habits like exercise and nutrition. In a small informal survey, at least five distinct concepts emerged, illustrating that health is multidimensional and personal.</p>

    <h2>Analyse the dimensions of Alonzo. Share your opinion and compare the list with your personal experience.</h2>
    <p>Sociologist Alonzo proposed four dimensions of health behaviour. <strong>Prevention</strong> involves actions such as exercise, balanced diet and vaccination to minimise disease risk. <strong>Detection</strong> refers to screening and testing to catch illnesses before symptoms appear. <strong>Promotion</strong> is about encouraging others to adopt healthy behaviours through public health campaigns. <strong>Protection</strong> focuses on creating a healthy environment, for example, by reducing pollution or improving workplace safety. In my experience, people are most engaged in prevention and detection—exercising, eating well and getting screenings—while promotion and protection often depend on broader community or policy initiatives.</p>

    <h2>Make a research! Interview people and ask them to describe their stages of illness experience. Compare the results with Suchman’s stages.</h2>
    <p>Edward Suchman outlined five stages of the illness experience: <strong>symptom experience</strong>, <strong>assumption of the sick role</strong>, <strong>contacting medical care</strong>, <strong>dependent patient role</strong> and <strong>recovery/rehabilitation</strong>. Interviews with friends revealed a similar sequence: people notice symptoms, try home remedies or wait to see if they improve, decide they are ill, seek a doctor’s opinion, follow treatment and then resume normal activities. However, modern experiences often skip or blur stages—online self‑diagnosis can delay medical contact, and some patients stop treatment early when they feel better. Chronic conditions also mean some people remain in a modified “sick role” indefinitely. Overall, Suchman’s model is useful but may need updating to reflect chronic illness and digital self‑care.</p>

    <h2>Analyse Parsons’ sick role concept and share your opinion and experience. Do you find new exceptions today?</h2>
    <p>Talcott Parsons’ sick role describes illness as a socially sanctioned form of deviance. Patients are exempt from normal responsibilities and not blamed for their condition, but they must want to get well and seek competent care. Doctors, in turn, are expected to use their expertise ethically and act in the patient’s best interest. In today’s society there are exceptions. People with chronic illnesses often manage their conditions while maintaining work and family roles, and those with mental health issues may not receive the same sympathy as those with physical ailments. When illnesses are linked to lifestyle factors (such as obesity or smoking) people may blame the patient rather than provide support. The rise of patient empowerment and shared decision‑making also challenges the passive patient model inherent in Parsons’ sick role.</p>

    <h2>List the medicalised fields of life. What are the pros and cons?</h2>
    <p>Medicalisation occurs when non‑medical aspects of life are defined and treated as medical problems. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Childbirth and pregnancy:</strong> Routine interventions and medical monitoring are common.</li>
      <li><strong>Race‑based medicine:</strong> Use of racially targeted drugs such as BiDil.</li>
      <li><strong>Sadness and depression:</strong> Treating normal fluctuations in mood as clinical disorders.</li>
      <li><strong>Menopause and ageing:</strong> Natural life stages are framed as medical malfunctions.</li>
      <li><strong>“Pre‑” conditions:</strong> Labels like pre‑hypertension or osteopenia lead to treatment of subclinical states.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Pros:</strong> Medicalisation can legitimise people’s experiences, provide access to effective treatments and reduce stigma. Recognising postpartum depression or ADHD has helped many receive appropriate care. <strong>Cons:</strong> Over‑medicalising normal life can lead to unnecessary tests, drug side‑effects and high costs. It may divert attention from social factors affecting health and can reinforce gender or racial biases. Medicalisation also risks shifting responsibility for structural problems onto individuals.</p>

    <h2>Introduce the concept of health.</h2>
    <p>Health is more than just the absence of disease. The World Health Organization defines it as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well‑being.” Social scientists emphasise that health is subjective and influenced by our social environment—the conditions into which we are born, live, work and age. Factors like income, education and community support shape our health just as much as genes or pathogens.</p>

    <h2>Introduce the biomedical focus of health.</h2>
    <p>The biomedical model views health as the absence of disease and treats illness as a physiological malfunction. In this approach, diagnosis and treatment are considered objective, value‑free tasks performed by medical professionals. The focus is on identifying and correcting biological abnormalities. While this model has led to significant medical advances, it often overlooks psychological and social influences on health.</p>

    <h2>Introduce the sociological (sociocultural) definition of health.</h2>
    <p>The sociological perspective recognises that health is shaped by cultural and social factors. People’s cultural backgrounds influence how they interpret and report symptoms, and social determinants—such as income, education and social support—affect health outcomes. Talcott Parsons suggested that health is the optimum capacity to perform social roles, highlighting that health is a resource for daily life rather than merely a biological state.</p>

    <h2>Introduce Alonzo’s four dimensions of health behaviour.</h2>
    <p>According to Alonzo, health behaviour has four dimensions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Prevention:</strong> Actions to minimise disease risk, such as exercising, eating a balanced diet and getting vaccinated.</li>
      <li><strong>Detection:</strong> Screenings and tests to identify diseases before symptoms appear.</li>
      <li><strong>Promotion:</strong> Campaigns and initiatives to encourage individuals and communities to adopt healthy behaviours.</li>
      <li><strong>Protection:</strong> Efforts to make the environment healthier by reducing pollution, ensuring safe workplaces and promoting public sanitation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What is illness behaviour?</h2>
    <p>Illness behaviour refers to how people perceive, evaluate and act upon their symptoms. Individuals interpret bodily sensations differently based on cultural norms, past experiences and social support. While some seek medical help quickly, others delay, self‑treat or ignore symptoms. Understanding illness behaviour helps explain variations in healthcare‑seeking practices and health outcomes.</p>

    <h2>Introduce Zola’s ‘social triggers.’</h2>
    <p>Sociologist Irving Zola identified five social triggers that push people to seek medical care:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Interference with work or daily activities:</strong> Symptoms that hinder the ability to work or carry out physical tasks.</li>
      <li><strong>Interference with social or personal relationships:</strong> Symptoms that disrupt social interactions or leisure.</li>
      <li><strong>Interpersonal crisis:</strong> Major life events (such as domestic violence or other crises) that reduce tolerance for symptoms.</li>
      <li><strong>Temporising of symptomatology:</strong> Setting deadlines to see if symptoms persist or recur.</li>
      <li><strong>Sanctioning:</strong> Pressure from family or friends urging the person to seek medical attention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Introduce the stages of illness experience.</h2>
    <p>Edward Suchman proposed five stages of how people experience illness:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Symptom experience:</strong> Recognising that something is wrong and possibly self‑treating or ignoring the problem.</li>
      <li><strong>Assumption of the sick role:</strong> Accepting that one is ill and deciding to get better.</li>
      <li><strong>Contacting medical care:</strong> Seeking professional validation and diagnosis.</li>
      <li><strong>Dependent patient role:</strong> Agreeing to treatment and following medical advice.</li>
      <li><strong>Recovery and rehabilitation:</strong> Gradually resuming normal roles and relinquishing the sick role.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These stages highlight that illness is not just a biological event but a social process influenced by perceptions, expectations and norms.</p>

    <h2>Describe medicalisation.</h2>
    <p><strong>Medicalisation</strong> is the process by which human conditions and behaviours become defined and treated as medical problems. It can be driven by new scientific evidence, shifting social attitudes, pharmaceutical marketing or economic incentives. Once a condition is labelled as medical, it is more likely to be studied, diagnosed and treated by healthcare professionals. Medicalisation can empower people by providing treatment and reducing stigma, but it also risks pathologising normal experiences and expanding medical authority into daily life.</p>
