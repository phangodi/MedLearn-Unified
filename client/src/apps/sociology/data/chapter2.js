It holds that biological factors interact with psychological factors (e.g., thoughts, emotions and behaviour) and social conditions (e.g., support networks, cultural norms, socioeconomic status). Illness is therefore understood holistically: recovery depends not only on treating physical symptoms but also on addressing mental health and social support. The model stresses that these three domains are interdependent and must all be considered to achieve wellness."
