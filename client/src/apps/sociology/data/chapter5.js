      text: "Research reveals a gender paradox: women think about suicide and attempt it more often, yet men die by suicide far more frequently. The key explanation lies in <strong>method choice and severity</strong>. Men tend to use more violent, lethal methods such as firearms, hanging or suffocation, while women are more likely to overdose or self‑poison. Because suicide attempts with firearms are fatal in nearly 90 % of cases, a man's first attempt often ends in death. Men also appear more fearless of death and more tolerant of pain, increasing the likelihood that they will carry out a lethal attempt. Conversely, women are twice as likely to be diagnosed with major depression and are more willing to seek treatment, which may help prevent fatal outcomes."

It seeks to explain patterns of morbidity and mortality by examining social structures and inequalities rather than relying solely on biological factors. Variables like income distribution, occupation, poverty and cultural norms are central to understanding why some groups are healthier than others."

      text: "<strong>Gender:</strong> Women report more illnesses and disabilities yet live about five years longer than men. Men often hold higher‑status jobs, experience greater work stress, and engage in riskier behaviours like heavy drinking and smoking. Women's caregiving roles encourage earlier health monitoring and more frequent doctor visits. When gender roles reverse—for example, women in high‑stress senior positions or men undertaking more housework—health indicators shift accordingly."

      text: "<strong>Age:</strong> Mortality follows a lopsided U‑shaped curve—high among infants, low in early adulthood and rising again in later life. Life expectancy depends on economic conditions and the quality of healthcare and social policies. Different age groups face different causes of death: leukaemia primarily affects children, while ischaemic heart disease is more common among older adults. Ageing also involves psychological and social changes, such as reduced cognitive flexibility and shifts in social roles."

      text: "<strong>Ethnic groups:</strong> Ethnic minorities often have lower social status and different lifestyle patterns. Disease prevalence varies by group; for example, ischaemic heart disease is more common among Asian populations, whereas stroke and hypertension are more prevalent in Afro‑Caribbean groups. These disparities stem from a mix of genetics, cultural practices, socioeconomic inequality and discrimination."

    {
      type: "paragraph",
      text: "<strong>Position in the workplace and occupation:</strong> Employment status and job type heavily influence health. Unemployment raises the risk of premature death, suicide, smoking and alcohol use. Hazardous working conditions, long hours and job insecurity also increase disease risk. The \"status syndrome\" observed in the Whitehall studies shows that mortality rates rise as occupational grade falls; men in the lowest civil‑service grades had mortality rates three times higher than those in the highest grades."

      type: "paragraph",
      text: "<strong>Social status:</strong> Lower social classes experience higher infant mortality, earlier death and more chronic diseases such as diabetes, obesity and coronary heart disease. The COVID‑19 pandemic revealed that working‑class populations faced disproportionately higher mortality. These patterns result from unequal access to resources, healthy environments and opportunities for health‑promoting behaviours."
