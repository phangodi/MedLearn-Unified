Common forms include violent crimes such as homicide and assault; property crimes like burglary and theft; drug use and trafficking (especially opioids and fentanyl); white‑collar crimes such as fraud and insider trading; gang activity and youth violence; and cybercrime. Social deviance also covers behaviours that break informal norms, such as tattooing, nontraditional gender expression and alternative lifestyles. Some behaviours once considered deviant—cohabitation, same‑sex relationships—have become more accepted over time."

It can signify cooperation and teamwork but may also arise from peer pressure. <strong>Obedience</strong> is compliance with orders from authority figures in a hierarchical structure. Classic studies by psychologists like Asch and Milgram show that people often conform or obey even when it conflicts with personal morals, highlighting the power of social influence."

      text: "Deviance is non‑conformity to a set of norms accepted by a significant number of people. It includes behaviour that violates laws (crime) and actions that break informal expectations. Examples range from serious offences like theft and assault to socially disapproved behaviours such as tattooing or drug use. Deviance is relative: what counts as deviant in one society may be normal in another, and norms change over time."

      text: "<strong>Biological theories</strong> historically posited that criminals could be identified by physical traits. Cesare Lombroso argued that criminals displayed atavistic characteristics inherited from earlier human forms. William Herbert Sheldon linked body types to delinquency, suggesting that muscular mesomorphs were more prone to aggression. Later claims that an extra Y chromosome (XYY) increased criminality have been disproven. Modern research finds little support for innate biological causes of deviance."

      text: "<strong>Psychological theories</strong> focus on personality and mental processes. The frustration–aggression hypothesis proposes that when people are prevented from achieving goals, they may respond with aggression, potentially leading to deviant behaviour. Frustration can also trigger regression or apathy. Personality disorders and mental health issues may contribute to deviance but are shaped by social context."

        "<strong>Durkheim's functionalist theory:</strong> Émile Durkheim argued that deviance is a normal part of society. He introduced the concept of <em>anomie</em> (normlessness) and saw crime and deviance as \"social facts\" that clarify moral boundaries and can promote social change.",
        "<strong>Merton's strain theory:</strong> Robert K. Merton observed that society encourages everyone to pursue material success, but legitimate means (education, employment) are unequally distributed. When people cannot achieve cultural goals through approved means, structural strain produces adaptations such as conformity, innovation, ritualism, retreatism and rebellion.",
        "<strong>Subcultural theory:</strong> Albert Cohen argued that status frustration among working‑class youths leads to the formation of delinquent subcultures, such as gangs, which reject middle‑class values and create their own norms celebrating defiance.",
        "<strong>Interactionist (labelling) theory:</strong> Interactionists focus on how behaviours come to be defined as deviant and why certain groups are labelled. They argue that deviance is not inherent in an act but arises from social reactions. Once labelled, individuals may internalise the deviant identity and continue the behaviour."
