Principal cells have ENaC/ROMK, not H-K pump.", "whyCorrect": {"a": "Intercalated cells (type A) in collecting duct express H+-K+-ATPase for acid secretion and K+ reabsorption."}, "whyIncorrect": {"b": "Proximal tubule uses Na+-H+ exchanger (NHE3), not H-K pump.", "c": "Principal cells have ENaC and ROMK, not H-K pump.", "d": "Distal tubule early segment doesn't have H-K pump.", "e": "Thick ascending limb has NKCC2, not H-K pump."}, "topicReference": "Topic 82: Acid-Base Regulation"},
    {"questionId": "q-2734027349-42", "summary": "Partially compensated metabolic acidosis: low pH, low HCO3- (primary), low pCO2 (respiratory compensation but incomplete). Option D shows pH 7.25, HCO3- 15mM (low=metabolic acidosis), pCO2 35 (low=respiratory compensation).", "whyCorrect": {"d": "pCO2=35, HCO3-=15, pH=7.25: Primary is low HCO3- (metabolic acidosis). pCO2 is low (respiratory compensation) but pH still acidotic=partial compensation."}, "whyIncorrect": {"a": "High pCO2 and HCO3- with high pH = respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation or metabolic alkalosis.", "b": "High pCO2 with normal HCO3- = respiratory acidosis.", "c": "High pCO2 with high HCO3- and normal pH = compensated respiratory acidosis.", "e": "Low pCO2 with low HCO3- but high pH = respiratory alkalosis."}, "topicReference": "Topic 82: Acid-Base Regulation"},
