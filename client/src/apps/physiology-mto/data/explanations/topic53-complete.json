      "summary": "The KIDNEY shows the most significant blood flow autoregulation. Renal blood flow and GFR remain constant over a wide range of arterial pressures (80-180 mmHg) through myogenic response and tubuloglomerular feedback. This is critical for maintaining stable GFR despite blood pressure fluctuations.",
      "whyCorrect": {
        "f": "The kidney has the most robust autoregulation of any organ. It maintains constant RBF and GFR over MAP 80-180 mmHg through: (1) Myogenic response - arterioles constrict when stretched, (2) Tubuloglomerular feedback - macula densa senses tubular NaCl and adjusts afferent arteriole tone."
      },
      "whyIncorrect": {
        "a": "Liver blood flow is relatively passive, depending on portal vein flow and hepatic artery. Autoregulation is minimal.",
        "b": "Spleen has minimal autoregulation. Blood flow changes passively with systemic pressure.",

      "summary": "Macula densa cells detect NaCl concentration in distal tubular fluid (via NKCC2 transporter). When NaCl increases (high GFR), they signal to CONSTRICT the afferent arteriole (reducing GFR) AND increase renin release. Renin is produced by juxtaglomerular (JG) cells, not macula densa. Macula densa is NOT a baroreceptor.",
      "whyCorrect": {
        "b": "The macula densa is a chemoreceptor that detects NaCl (specifically Cl-) concentration in tubular fluid at the early distal tubule. NKCC2 transporter mediates this sensing.",
        "e": "When tubular NaCl concentration INCREASES, macula densa signals juxtaglomerular cells to release renin. This activates RAAS to help restore volume/pressure when tubular NaCl is high."

        "a": "Renin is produced by JUXTAGLOMERULAR (JG) cells in the afferent arteriole wall, NOT by macula densa cells. Macula densa signals TO JG cells.",

      "whyCorrect": {
        "a": "Kidneys receive approximately 400 mL/min/100g of tissue (4 mL/min/g), the highest of any organ. This reflects the need for high flow for filtration, not just oxygen delivery. Total RBF is ~1200 mL/min for ~300g of kidney tissue."

Functional hyperemia is NOT characteristic (kidneys filter, not metabolize).",
