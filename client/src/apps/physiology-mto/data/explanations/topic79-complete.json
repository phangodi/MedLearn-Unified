    {"questionId": "q-2734027349-14", "summary": "Aldosterone secretion is stimulated by: (1) High K+ (direct adrenal effect), (2) Angiotensin II (RAAS), (3) Low Na+ (via RAAS). NOT by high Na+ or Angiotensin I.", "whyCorrect": {"b": "Increased K+ directly stimulates zona glomerulosa to secrete aldosterone.", "d": "Angiotensin II is a major stimulator of aldosterone release.", "f": "Decreased Na+ activates RAAS → Ang II → aldosterone."}, "whyIncorrect": {"a": "High Na+ suppresses aldosterone (less need for Na retention).", "c": "Angiotensin I is inactive; must be converted to Ang II by ACE.", "e": "Low K+ suppresses aldosterone (less need for K excretion)."}, "topicReference": "Topic 79: Aldosterone"},
    {"questionId": "q-2734027349-26", "summary": "ANP effects: increases GFR, inhibits aldosterone effect, increases Na+ excretion (natriuresis). Does NOT increase Na+ reabsorption - opposite effect.", "whyCorrect": {"a": "ANP dilates afferent and constricts efferent arteriole → increases GFR.", "b": "ANP antagonizes mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) effects in collecting tubule.", "d": "ANP increases Na+ excretion (natriuresis) - promotes Na+ loss."}, "whyIncorrect": {"c": "ANP DECREASES Na+ reabsorption, promoting natriuresis."}, "topicReference": "Topic 79: ANP"},
    {"questionId": "q-2734027349-36", "summary": "ANH (ANP) inhibits vasopressin-stimulated water reabsorption in collecting duct. This promotes water excretion (aquaresis) along with natriuresis.", "whyCorrect": {"c": "ANP/ANH inhibits ADH-stimulated water reabsorption in collecting duct, promoting diuresis."}, "whyIncorrect": {"a": "ENaC channels are aldosterone-regulated, ANP works differently.", "b": "Na-H exchange in PT is not a primary ANP target.", "d": "NKCC2 in thick ascending limb is not primary ANP target."}, "topicReference": "Topic 79: ANP"},
    {"questionId": "q-2734027349-38", "summary": "Renin secretion is increased by: decreased renal perfusion, decreased BP, beta-1 sympathetic stimulation. NOT by excess salt or parasympathetic.", "whyCorrect": {"c": "Decreased renal perfusion is sensed by baroreceptors in afferent arteriole → renin release.", "d": "Decreased arterial BP reduces renal perfusion → renin release.", "e": "Beta-1 adrenergic stimulation of JG cells directly increases renin secretion."}, "whyIncorrect": {"a": "Excess salt intake SUPPRESSES renin (negative feedback).", "b": "Parasympathetic has minimal direct effect on renin; sympathetic is key."}, "topicReference": "Topic 79: RAAS"}
