      "summary": "Vasoconstriction uses IP3 pathway: alpha-1 receptors → PLC → IP3 → Ca²⁺ release → contraction. cGMP and cAMP both cause RELAXATION (vasodilation), not constriction.",
      "whyCorrect": {
        "d": "IP3 (inositol trisphosphate) mediates vasoconstriction. Alpha-1 receptor activation → phospholipase C → IP3 production → Ca²⁺ release from SR → smooth muscle contraction."

        "a": "cGMP ACTIVATION causes vasoDILATION (NO/nitric oxide pathway).",

      "summary": "Increased cAMP in vascular smooth muscle causes RELAXATION. cAMP activates PKA → phosphorylates MLCK → decreased Ca²⁺ sensitivity → relaxation. cAMP does NOT activate NOS or cause contraction.",
      "whyCorrect": {
        "b": "Increased cAMP causes vascular smooth muscle RELAXATION. cAMP → PKA → phosphorylation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) → reduced Ca²⁺ sensitivity → relaxation/vasodilation."
      },
      "whyIncorrect": {
        "a": "NOS (nitric oxide synthase) is activated by Ca²⁺/calmodulin, not by cAMP.",
        "c": "The Na⁺/K⁺ pump is not directly activated by cAMP in this context.",
        "d": "Increased cAMP causes RELAXATION, not contraction. Contraction uses IP3/Ca²⁺ pathway."

      "summary": "Vasoconstriction is mediated by IP3 signaling: alpha receptors → PLC → IP3 → Ca²⁺ release → contraction. cGMP, cAMP, and PGE2 generally cause vasodilation.",
      "whyCorrect": {
        "d": "IP3 (inositol trisphosphate) mediates vasoconstriction. Gq-coupled receptors (alpha-1) activate PLC → IP3 → releases Ca²⁺ from SR → smooth muscle contracts."
      },
      "whyIncorrect": {
        "a": "cGMP stimulation causes vasoDILATION via NO pathway, not vasoconstriction.",
        "b": "PGE2 generally causes vasodilation (though effects vary by receptor subtype and vascular bed).",
        "c": "cAMP stimulation causes vasoDILATION via beta receptor pathway."
