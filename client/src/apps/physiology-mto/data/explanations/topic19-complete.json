      "summary": "Parasympathetic vasodilator neurotransmitters: (1) ACh - activates eNOS in endothelium, (2) VIP - direct smooth muscle relaxation, (3) NO - released as cotransmitter. NOT: NPY (sympathetic), PGI2 (from endothelium not nerves), adrenaline (sympathetic).",
      "whyCorrect": {
        "c": "VIP (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) is released from parasympathetic nerves and causes direct smooth muscle relaxation.",
        "d": "Acetylcholine is the primary parasympathetic neurotransmitter. In blood vessels, it acts on endothelial muscarinic receptors to release NO, causing vasodilation.",
        "e": "NO (nitric oxide) is released as a cotransmitter from some parasympathetic nerve endings, directly causing vasodilation via cGMP."
      },
      "whyIncorrect": {
        "a": "NPY (neuropeptide Y) is released from SYMPATHETIC nerve endings and causes vasoconstriction.",
        "b": "Prostacyclin (PGI2) is produced by vascular ENDOTHELIUM, not released from nerve endings.",
        "f": "Adrenaline (epinephrine) is from adrenal medulla and sympathetic system, not parasympathetic."
