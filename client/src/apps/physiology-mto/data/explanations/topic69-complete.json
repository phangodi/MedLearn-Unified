    {"questionId": "q-2734027349-12", "summary": "Caloric equivalence of O2 for mixed diet is ~20.2 kJ/L (or ~4.83 kcal/L). Pure carbs=21kJ/L, fat=19.6kJ/L, protein=18.8kJ/L. Mixed diet averages ~20 kJ/L.", "whyCorrect": {"e": "20.2 kJ/L is the caloric equivalence of oxygen for a typical mixed diet (RQ ~0.82). This allows indirect calorimetry to calculate energy expenditure from O2 consumption."}, "whyIncorrect": {"a": "17.2 kJ/L is too low.", "b": "26.5 kJ/L is too high.", "c": "40 kJ/L is too high.", "d": "40 kcal/L is way too high - normal is ~5 kcal/L."}, "topicReference": "Topic 69: Metabolism"},
    {"questionId": "q-2734027349-19", "summary": "Metabolic rate = total energy expenditure per unit time = heat production + external work. None of the given options correctly define it.", "whyCorrect": {"e": "None of the above is correct. Metabolic rate = Heat produced + External work performed. Options a-d either miss components or incorrectly include storage."}, "whyIncorrect": {"a": "Storage alone is not metabolic rate.", "b": "Missing heat production.", "c": "Energy output is vague; should be heat + work.", "d": "Storage + heat misses external work."}, "topicReference": "Topic 69: Metabolism"},
    {"questionId": "q-2734027349-20", "summary": "Measuring BMR via O2 consumption is INDIRECT calorimetry. Direct calorimetry measures actual heat produced. Spirometry measures lung volumes, not metabolism.", "whyCorrect": {"a": "Indirect calorimetry measures O2 consumption (and often CO2 production) to calculate metabolic rate using caloric equivalence of oxygen."}, "whyIncorrect": {"b": "Plethysmograph measures body/lung volumes, not metabolism.", "c": "Spirometry measures lung volumes and airflow, not metabolic rate.", "d": "Oximetry measures blood O2 saturation, not consumption."}, "topicReference": "Topic 69: Metabolism"}
