      "questionId": "q-2734027349-17",
      "summary": "Central chemoreceptors respond to CSF/brain pH changes caused by CO2. Increased arterial pCO2 → CO2 diffuses into CSF → H⁺ increases (pH drops) → stimulates breathing. They DON'T respond to O2 levels or venous blood.",
      "whyCorrect": {
        "c": "Reduced arterial pH (acidosis) stimulates central chemoreceptors. CO2 crosses blood-brain barrier → forms H⁺ in CSF → detected by medullary chemoreceptors → increases ventilation.",
        "d": "Increased arterial pCO2 is the PRIMARY stimulus. CO2 readily diffuses across BBB, converts to H⁺ in CSF, stimulating central chemoreceptors to increase respiration."
      },
      "whyIncorrect": {
        "a": "INCREASED pH (alkalosis) would DECREASE respiratory drive, not increase it.",
        "b": "Central chemoreceptors don't respond to venous pO2. They detect arterial/CSF changes, not venous.",
        "e": "INCREASED brain interstitial pH (alkalosis) would decrease respiratory drive. It's DECREASED pH that stimulates.",
        "f": "Central chemoreceptors respond primarily to CO2/H⁺, NOT oxygen. Peripheral chemoreceptors (carotid/aortic bodies) detect O2."
