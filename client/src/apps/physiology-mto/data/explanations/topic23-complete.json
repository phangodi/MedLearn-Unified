      "summary": "Muscle fiber recruitment: (1) Size principle - small motor neurons (Type I) recruited first, then larger (Type II); (2) Type I = slow, fatigue-resistant, used first; (3) Type II = fast, powerful, recruited for high force; (4) Most muscles have mixed fiber types.",
      "whyCorrect": {
        "a": "Size principle: Motor units are recruited from smallest (weakest, Type I) to largest (strongest, Type II). Small motor neurons have lower thresholds and are activated first.",
        "d": "Most human skeletal muscles contain BOTH Type I (slow oxidative) and Type II (fast glycolytic) fibers in varying proportions depending on muscle function."
      },
      "whyIncorrect": {
        "b": "Type I fibers are for SUSTAINED activity and fatigue resistance, NOT peak force. Peak force requires Type II fast-twitch fibers.",
        "c": "During LOW intensity activity, Type I fibers are used FIRST (not Type II). Type II is recruited only for high-intensity/high-force activities."
