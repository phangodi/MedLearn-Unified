      "questionId": "q-4447200607-1",
      "summary": "Conduction velocities: SA node SLOWEST (~0.05 m/s) due to Ca²⁺-dependent APs, small cells, poor gap junctions. AV node also slow. Bundle of His and Purkinje fastest (~4 m/s). Ventricular muscle intermediate (~1 m/s).",
      "whyCorrect": {
        "a": "SA node has the SLOWEST conduction velocity (~0.05 m/s). Reasons: (1) Ca²⁺-dependent action potentials (slow upstroke); (2) Small cell size; (3) Sparse gap junctions; (4) This slow conduction allows proper pacemaker function."
      },
      "whyIncorrect": {
        "b": "Bundle of His has FAST conduction (~1-2 m/s) to rapidly transmit impulses to ventricles.",
        "c": "Ventricles have intermediate velocity (~1 m/s) - faster than nodes but slower than Purkinje fibers.",
        "d": "Atria have moderate conduction velocity (~1 m/s), not the slowest.",
        "e": "Conduction velocity is NOT the same everywhere - it varies dramatically from 0.05 m/s (SA node) to 4 m/s (Purkinje fibers)."
