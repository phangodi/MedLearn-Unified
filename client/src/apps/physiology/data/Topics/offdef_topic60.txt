// Describe the characteristics of the spontaneous and stimulated electrical activity of GI smooth muscles
officialDefinitions: [
  'GI smooth muscle organization: GI smooth muscle cells are small (200-500 µm long, 2-10 µm diameter) and arranged in bundles of up to 1000 fibers. The GI tract contains two muscle layers: Longitudinal muscle → Shortens the intestinal segment. Circular muscle → Reduces the lumen diameter. Smooth muscle cells are electrically coupled via gap junctions, allowing ions to spread easily from one cell to another. This syncytial arrangement ensures coordinated contractions, allowing the spread of electrical activity throughout the muscle mass. Electrical signals travel more rapidly along the length of muscle fibers than laterally.',
  'Phasic contractions (rhythmic): Brief, periodic contractions followed by relaxation. Found in the esophagus, gastric antrum, and intestines, where food is mixed and propelled.',
  'Tonic contractions (sustained): Continuous contractions lasting minutes to hours. Found in sphincters (e.g., lower esophageal, pyloric, ileocecal, and internal anal sphincters) and the proximal stomach. Can be caused by: continuous spike potentials, sustained depolarization without action potentials, hormonal modulation.',
  'Slow waves (Basal Electrical Rhythm - BER): Slow waves are a unique feature of the electrical activity of gastrointestinal smooth muscle. Slow waves are not action potentials but rather oscillating depolarization and repolarization of the membrane potential of the smooth muscle cells. Slow waves are cyclic fluctuations in resting membrane potential. They are not action potentials but set the rhythmic baseline for motility. Slow waves alone do not cause contractions unless they reach threshold and trigger action potentials. The BER is always present, BUT alone it cannot cause action potential (AP) and muscle contraction.',
  'Origin of slow waves: The precise cause of the slow waves is not completely understood, although they appear to be caused by complex interactions among the smooth muscle cells and specialized cells, the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are abundant in the myenteric plexus. Cyclic depolarizations and repolarizations occur spontaneously in the interstitial cells of Cajal and spread rapidly to adjacent smooth muscle via low-resistance gap junctions. Just as the sinoatrial node is the pacemaker of the heart, the interstitial cells of Cajal can be considered the pacemaker for gastrointestinal smooth muscle. In each region of the gastrointestinal tract, the pacemaker drives the frequency of slow waves, which determines the rate at which action potentials and contractions can occur.',
  'Slow wave ion mechanisms and frequency: Depolarization phase: cyclic opening of Ca²⁺ channels, allowing a slow Ca²⁺ influx. Plateau phase: sustained Ca²⁺ entry, maintaining the depolarized state. Repolarization phase: opening of K⁺ channels, leading to K⁺ efflux and return to resting membrane potential. The slow membrane potential oscillations in the pacemaker cells are elicited by the cyclic opening-closing of K⁺ channels. If the depolarization waves reach the threshold of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, then action potentials are triggered. Frequency varies by GI region: Stomach: ~3 slow waves/min (BER period 15-20 s). Duodenum: ~12 slow waves/min. Ileum: ~8-9 slow waves/min. Small intestine: 5-8 s cycle period.',
  'Significance of BER in GI smooth muscle control: Depolarising effects (transmitters, hormones) cause the membrane potential to first reach the threshold at the peaks of the slow waves, eliciting AP and contraction. The contractions will be "automatically" rhythmic and travelling. The degree of depolarisation will control AP (spike) frequency. As Ca²⁺ enters during the APs, the amplitude of the contraction will be changed by the length of the AP train. The frequency of contractions depends on the slow waves; the force of contractions depends on the number of spikes.',
  'Modulation by neural and hormonal inputs: Excitatory inputs (e.g., ACh, Gastrin, Substance P): increase slow wave amplitude, making action potentials more likely. Inhibitory inputs (e.g., Norepinephrine, VIP, NO): hyperpolarize the membrane, reducing slow wave amplitude and suppressing contractions. The normal resting membrane potential of GI smooth muscle is around -50 to -60 mV.',
  'Spike potentials (action potentials): True action potentials that occur on top of slow waves. Occur only when the slow wave depolarizes the membrane to threshold (-40 mV or higher). Higher slow wave peaks = more spike potentials per second (1-10 spikes/sec). The greater the number of spike potentials, the stronger the contraction. Unlike neuronal action potentials (which use fast Na⁺ channels), GI smooth muscle spike potentials are mediated by slow Ca²⁺-Na⁺ channels. Voltage-gated L-type Ca²⁺ channels open, allowing Ca²⁺ influx (major contributor) and Na⁺ influx (minor contributor). GI smooth muscle APs last much longer (10-40 times longer) due to slow Ca²⁺ channel kinetics. They rely primarily on Ca²⁺ influx instead of Na⁺ influx, making contraction dependent on extracellular Ca²⁺ levels.',

// Describe the anatomical locations and role of interstitial cells of Cajal
officialDefinitions: [
  'Interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) - identity and location: They are specialized cells that are considered to be the pacemaker for GI smooth muscle. They form a network with each other and are found between the smooth muscle layers (mainly in the myenteric plexus). The BER is created in the interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) of the pacemaker areas. The circular muscle forms sphincters at selected points. The basis of rhythmic activity from the stomach to the sigmoid colon is a special electric feature called slow waves that create a basal electric rhythm (BER). The BER is produced by anatomically nondescript pacemaker areas with various cycle periods: stomach: 15-20 s, small intestine 5-8 s, colon > minutes.',
  'ICC as pacemakers - mechanism: Cyclic depolarization and repolarization occur spontaneously in these cells and spread rapidly to adjacent smooth muscle via low-resistance gap junctions, which may generate slow waves. The slow wave is propagated through the gap junction of the functional syncytium in the smooth muscle layer. Just as the sinoatrial node is the pacemaker of the heart, the interstitial cells of Cajal can be considered the pacemaker for gastrointestinal smooth muscle.',
  'ICCs as mediators of ENS inputs - general: ICCs are essential intermediaries between enteric neurons and smooth muscle cells, transmitting signals that modulate gut motility based on physiological demands. Interstitial cells of Cajal mediate enteric neurotransmission.',
  'Excitatory ENS inputs via ICCs: ICCs receive excitatory input from ENS motor neurons, which release: Acetylcholine (ACh) → stimulates depolarization, making slow waves more likely to trigger action potentials. Substance P → enhances the strength of smooth muscle contractions. These neurotransmitters bind to receptors on ICCs, leading to membrane depolarization and increased slow wave amplitude, which enhances contractile activity.',
  'Inhibitory ENS inputs via ICCs: ICCs also receive inhibitory signals from ENS neurons that release: Nitric Oxide (NO) → activates cGMP pathways, causing hyperpolarization and muscle relaxation. Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) → reduces slow wave amplitude and inhibits contractions. These inhibitory neurotransmitters prevent slow waves from reaching the action potential threshold, allowing for sphincter relaxation and segmental motility control.',
  'ICC role in large intestine: Cajal-cells regulate motor activity in the large intestine. Hirschsprung-disorder results in megacolon due to loss of ICCs and enteric inhibitory neuron cells in the affected bowel segment.',

// Describe major motor patterns in the GI tract during fasting (MMC) and during digestion
officialDefinitions: [
  'Migrating Motor Complex (MMC) - definition and characteristics: The Migrating Myoelectric Complex (MMC) is periodic electrical and motor (peristaltic) activity in the EMPTY stomach-small intestine tract (interdigestive phase or starvation). 6-10 min active periods followed by approximately 1.5 hour long pause. The activity originates in the stomach and is propagated to the end of the ileum. Function: transport of undigestible remnants larger than 2 mm into the colon. Control: motilin. The MMC occurs during starvation or the interdigestive phase, typically 90-120 minutes after the last meal.',
  'MMC phases: Phase I (Quiescent Phase): No spike potentials - No contractions - The gut is at rest. Phase II (Irregular Contractions): Irregular spike potentials - Weak, uncoordinated contractions - Gradual increase in peristaltic activity. Phase III (Active Contraction Phase): Regular spike potentials - Strong peristaltic contractions - Sweeps undigested material into the colon - Controlled primarily by motilin.',
  'MMC regulation and hunger contractions: Motilin is the key hormone that triggers Phase III contractions of the MMC. Ghrelin, a hunger hormone, also plays a role in initiating MMC activity. The MMC is regulated by the enteric nervous system (ENS). Vagal nerve activity helps coordinate contractions. As part of the MMC, hunger contractions occur in the stomach; these contractions may cause mild pain or discomfort in the pit of the stomach, typically after 12-24 hours of fasting, commonly referred to as hunger pangs.',
  'Peristalsis during digestion: Peristalsis is the fundamental propulsive movement of the GI tract, ensuring that food moves progressively toward the anus. It occurs throughout the digestive system, including the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. A contractile ring forms around the gut tube and moves forward, pushing contents ahead. The usual stimulus for peristalsis is distension, where food stretches the gut wall, activating mechanoreceptors in the ENS. The contraction occurs 2-3 cm behind the food bolus, while relaxation occurs ahead of it. The myenteric plexus of the ENS is essential for peristalsis; if absent or impaired (as in Hirschsprung\'s disease), peristalsis is weak or absent.',
  'Segmentation contractions during digestion: Segmentation contractions are essential for mixing food with digestive enzymes and bile while ensuring that nutrients are efficiently absorbed. The circular muscle layer contracts at multiple points along the intestine. These contractions break the chyme into smaller portions and mix it with digestive secretions. Unlike peristalsis, segmentation does not propel food forward but rather ensures even mixing. The contractions last 5 to 30 seconds, then disappear and reappear at different locations, continuously "chopping" the food. Small intestine is the most active site of segmentation; controlled by ENS slow waves and vagal input.',
  'Mass movements in the colon: Mass movements are strong peristaltic waves that push fecal material toward the rectum; triggered by the gastrocolic reflex, which occurs after eating.',

// Describe the nervous regulation of peristaltic movement. Define the Bayliss-Starling law of the gut.
officialDefinitions: [
  'Nervous regulation of peristalsis - Step 1 (Sensory Detection): The food bolus in the intestinal lumen is detected by enterochromaffin (ECL) cells located in the intestinal mucosa. These ECL cells respond to mechanical and chemical stimulation by releasing serotonin (5-HT).',
  'Nervous regulation of peristalsis - Step 2 (IPAN Activation): Serotonin binds to receptors on intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs), which are sensory neurons within the ENS. When activated, IPANs initiate the peristaltic reflex by communicating with interneurons in the myenteric plexus. Mucosal stimulation causes serotonin release from a mucosal chromaffin cell. Serotonin will activate an ENS sensory neuron that uses CGRP as a transmitter.',
  'Nervous regulation of peristalsis - Step 3 (Motor Neuron Coordination): The peristaltic reflex involves two opposing motor responses. Excitatory motor neurons (behind the bolus): release acetylcholine (ACh) and substance P, cause circular muscle contraction behind the bolus, pushing it forward. In the oral direction a cholinergic interneuron will be activated that will activate an excitatory effector neuron using Substance P as transmitter (TK-tachykinin) causing smooth muscle contraction. Inhibitory motor neurons (ahead of the bolus): release nitric oxide (NO), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and ATP, cause relaxation of circular muscle ahead of the bolus, allowing forward movement. In the caudal direction, an inhibitory interneuron using somatostatin is excited that will inhibit another inhibitory interneuron using endogenous opiates as transmitters (Enk-enkephalin); the disinhibition will activate finally a VIP-ergic inhibitory effector neuron: the result will be smooth muscle dilation.',
  'Nervous regulation of peristalsis - Step 4 (Wave Propagation and ANS modulation): The contractile ring moves progressively forward, propelling the bolus along the intestine. This mechanism is often referred to as the myenteric reflex or peristaltic reflex and is governed by the "law of the gut", ensuring movement occurs only in the anal direction. Parasympathetic stimulation (via the vagus nerve) enhances peristalsis by increasing excitatory neurotransmitter release. Sympathetic stimulation (via norepinephrine) inhibits peristalsis by reducing excitatory neuron activity and increasing inhibitory input.',
  'Bayliss-Starling Law of the Gut - definition: Stimulation in the GI tract elicits gut movements: 1. Contraction on the oral side of the stimulation, and 2. relaxation on the caudal (aboral) side, and 3. the contractile ring preceded by dilatation moves in aboral direction. The Bayliss-Starling Law of the Gut states that when the intestinal wall is distended by a food bolus, a peristaltic reflex is triggered, leading to contraction behind the bolus and relaxation ahead of it, propelling the contents forward.',
  'Bayliss-Starling Law - mechanism: Detection of distension: When food enters a segment of the intestine, it stretches the gut wall, activating sensory intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs) of the enteric nervous system (ENS). Behind the bolus: Excitatory motor neurons release acetylcholine (ACh) and substance P, causing circular muscle contraction to push the food forward. Ahead of the bolus: Inhibitory motor neurons release nitric oxide (NO), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and ATP, leading to circular muscle relaxation, allowing the bolus to move forward. The reflex always moves in the anal direction, ensuring proper propulsion of intestinal contents. Functions independently of the central nervous system (CNS), controlled primarily by the ENS (myenteric plexus).',

// Describe how extrinsic nerves (sympathetic and parasympathetic) affect motor patterns
officialDefinitions: [
  'Parasympathetic control - overview and anatomy: Parasympathetic control generally enhances GI motility and secretion, promoting digestion. Vagus nerve (CN X) innervates the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, small intestine, and proximal large intestine. Pelvic nerves innervate the distal large intestine, rectum, and anus. Preganglionic fibers synapse within the myenteric and submucosal plexuses of the ENS.',
  'Parasympathetic control - mechanism and effects: Postganglionic neurons release acetylcholine (ACh), which binds to muscarinic receptors (M3) on smooth muscle, stimulating contractions. Effects on motor patterns: enhances peristalsis by stimulating excitatory neurons in the ENS, increasing the strength and frequency of peristaltic waves; stimulates segmentation contractions; facilitates sphincter relaxation. Overall effect: parasympathetic stimulation enhances digestion by promoting motility, secretion, and sphincter relaxation. The parasympathetic nervous system can also activate inhibitory NANC (non-adrenergic non-cholinergic) ganglion cells that release NO/VIP, causing smooth muscle inhibition.',
  'Sympathetic control - overview and anatomy: Sympathetic control generally inhibits GI motility, reducing digestion during stress or "fight-or-flight" responses. Sympathetic fibers originate from the thoracolumbar spinal cord (T5-L2). Preganglionic fibers synapse in prevertebral ganglia (celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric ganglia). Postganglionic fibers reach the ENS, smooth muscle, and blood vessels.',
  'Sympathetic control - mechanism and effects: Postganglionic neurons release norepinephrine (NE), which binds to: α2 receptors on ENS neurons, inhibiting excitatory neurotransmitter release (ACh); β2 receptors on smooth muscle, leading to direct relaxation. Adrenergic neurons of the sympathetic nerves can also exert direct constrictor effects on vascular smooth muscle and sphincters (α1 receptor). Effects on motor patterns: inhibits peristalsis, reduces segmentation contractions, increases sphincter tone, reduces blood flow to the gut. Overall effect: sympathetic stimulation slows digestion, tightens sphincters, and redirects blood flow to essential organs (heart, brain, muscles).',
  'Short reflex - sympathetic inhibitory role: The short reflex afferent is a primary sensory neuron originating from the GIS; the reflex is integrated OUTSIDE the CNS, in the autonomic sympathetic ganglion; the efferent is a sympathetic postganglionic neuron. These reflexes are inhibitory (e.g., painful stretch inhibits gut motility). In the ileogastric reflex, distension of the ileum sends inhibitory signals via sympathetic ganglia, leading to reduced gastric motility.',

// Describe the functional importance of tonic inhibitory input from enteric motor neurons
officialDefinitions: [
  'Tonic inhibition - definition: Tonic inhibition in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract refers to the continuous suppression of smooth muscle activity to regulate motility and prevent excessive contractions. This inhibition is primarily mediated by the enteric nervous system (ENS) through inhibitory motor neurons that release neurotransmitters such as nitric oxide (NO), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), and ATP, which induce smooth muscle relaxation. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) also contributes, with sympathetic stimulation releasing norepinephrine (NE) to reduce motility.',
  'Tonic inhibition - Function 1 (Prevents excessive contraction): Maintains basal smooth muscle tone, ensuring that contractions occur only when necessary. Prevents spasmodic contractions, which can lead to pain, obstruction, or dysmotility. Without inhibitory input, GI smooth muscle would remain in a constant state of contraction, leading to spasms, pain, and dysmotility disorders.',
  'Tonic inhibition - Function 2 (Coordinates peristalsis): Inhibitory input ensures smooth propagation of peristaltic waves by relaxing the muscle segment ahead of the bolus while contraction occurs behind it. This follows the Bayliss-Starling Law of the Gut, where contraction behind and relaxation ahead of a food bolus ensures efficient propulsion.',
  'Tonic inhibition - Function 3 (Regulates sphincter function): Inhibitory neurons maintain the ability of sphincters to relax when needed, ensuring proper transit of food: Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) allows food entry into the stomach. Pyloric Sphincter regulates gastric emptying. Ileocecal Valve controls movement from the small to the large intestine. Internal Anal Sphincter facilitates controlled defecation.',
  'Loss of tonic inhibition - clinical consequences (Achalasia): Achalasia is caused by loss of the distal part of the myenteric plexus. The portion of the esophagus cannot relax and cannot receive and pass the bolus. The bolus accumulates proximally to the affected portion and starts dilating the esophagus. Tonic inhibition plays a crucial role in maintaining sphincter function; dysfunction in this system can lead to spastic motility disorders, such as achalasia, where tonic inhibition is impaired.',
  'Loss of tonic inhibition - clinical consequences (Hirschsprung\'s disease and others): Regulation of motor activity in the large intestine depends on Cajal-cells and ENS inhibitory neuron cells; Hirschsprung-disorder results in megacolon. Conditions like gastroparesis occur where excessive inhibition results in delayed gastric emptying. Gut Paralysis (Ileus): a condition where the intestines fail to contract, leading to food and fluid retention, bloating, and constipation. Over-dilated intestinal segments experience reduced blood flow, increasing the risk of intestinal necrosis and perforation.',

// Describe how distension of organs affects GI reflexes; abnormal distension causing pain and abnormal motility
officialDefinitions: [
  'Distension-induced GI reflexes - receptive relaxation: Distension of gastrointestinal (GI) organs plays a crucial role in regulating motility and secretion through reflex pathways. When food enters the lower esophagus, it triggers a reflex relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and the orad stomach, a process known as receptive relaxation. This reflex lowers intragastric pressure and increases the storage capacity of the stomach, allowing it to accommodate up to 1.5L of food. The vagus nerve mediates this process through a vagovagal reflex, where mechanoreceptors detect the distension and send signals to the central nervous system (CNS), which in turn sends efferent signals back to the stomach, causing relaxation. The neurotransmitter vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) plays a key role in this process by promoting smooth muscle relaxation.',
  'Gastrocolic and other distension-induced reflexes: The gastrocolic reflex occurs when the stomach expands after food intake, triggering increased motility in the colon. This reflex facilitates mass movements in the large intestine, helping to clear waste and prepare for defecation. The afferent limb of this reflex is located in the stomach and is mediated by the parasympathetic nervous system (PSNS), while the efferent limb increases colonic contractions, primarily influenced by the hormones cholecystokinin (CCK) and gastrin. Duodeno-colic reflex: duodenum distension → colon motility increase. Ileogastric reflex: ileum distension → decreased stomach motility.',
  'Distension and interaction with other regulatory inputs: These distension-related reflexes interact with other hormonal and autonomic regulatory inputs, ensuring efficient digestion and waste clearance. The enteric nervous system (ENS) plays a central role in integrating these signals, coordinating gastric emptying, intestinal transit, and colonic activity based on the volume and composition of the ingested food. Dysfunction in these reflexes can lead to gastric motility disorders such as gastroparesis, achalasia, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), resulting in symptoms like delayed gastric emptying, dysmotility, or excessive peristalsis.',
  'Abnormal distension causing GI pain - visceral nociceptors: Abnormal distension of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract occurs when excessive gas, fluid, or solid material accumulates within the lumen, stretching the intestinal walls. Mechanoreceptors in the intestinal wall detect excessive stretch. These receptors are located in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses and are stimulated by excessive gas, fluid, or fecal retention. Signals are sent via afferent visceral sensory fibers (C fibers) to the central nervous system (CNS). Neural pathways involved in GI pain perception: Vagal afferents (to the brainstem) → modulate nausea, bloating, and discomfort. Spinal afferents (via sympathetic nerves) → send pain signals to the thoracolumbar spinal cord, which are interpreted as abdominal pain or cramping.',
  'Abnormal distension - chemical mediators of pain: Proinflammatory mediators such as prostaglandins, histamine, serotonin (5-HT), and substance P sensitize nociceptors. Serotonin (5-HT) released from enterochromaffin cells (ECLs) amplifies pain by activating intrinsic primary afferent neurons (IPANs), enhancing reflex responses. Bradykinin and cytokines (e.g., TNF-α, IL-6) contribute to neuropathic pain and inflammation in conditions like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).',
  'Abnormal distension causing dysfunctional motility - reflex inhibition (ileus): Severe distension inhibits peristalsis via the enterogastric and ileogastric reflexes. Afferent signals from overstretched segments activate sympathetic pathways → inhibitory ENS reflexes suppress peristalsis. Leads to delayed gastric emptying, ileus, and constipation. Gut Paralysis (Ileus): a condition where the intestines fail to contract, leading to food and fluid retention, bloating, and constipation. Lack of bowel sounds is an alarming sign of ileus. Unabsorbed fluid accumulation in the intestines can cause severe dehydration leading to hypovolemic shock.',
  'Abnormal distension causing dysfunctional motility - hypercontractility and spasms: Some forms of distension (e.g., partial obstructions or IBS) cause excessive ENS excitatory activity, resulting in spasmodic contractions. Stretch-activated excitatory neurons release acetylcholine (ACh) and substance P, leading to strong but uncoordinated contractions. This produces colicky pain, bloating, and diarrhea. Over-dilated intestinal segments experience reduced blood flow, increasing the risk of intestinal necrosis and perforation.',
