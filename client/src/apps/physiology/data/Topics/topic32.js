        'Pulmonary vascular endothelium: plays a crucial role in the production of angiotensin II through the expression and action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This enzyme is primarily located on the surface of the endothelial cells lining the pulmonary capillaries and serves a key function in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is important for regulating blood pressure and fluid balance.',

        'Function of Angiotensin II: Vasoconstriction: Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, which increases systemic vascular resistance and raises blood pressure. Aldosterone Secretion: It stimulates the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone, which promotes sodium and water retention in the kidneys, contributing to an increase in blood volume and pressure. Fluid and Electrolyte Balance: Angiotensin II also influences the balance of fluids and electrolytes, helping maintain homeostasis.',
        'Regulation of Blood Pressure: By producing angiotensin II, the pulmonary endothelium plays an essential role in maintaining blood pressure, especially under conditions where increased blood pressure is needed, such as during dehydration or blood loss.'
