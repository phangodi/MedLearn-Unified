          'Electrophoresis: a crucial technique in clinical laboratories used to separate plasma proteins into distinct fractions based on their migration in an electric field. This method helps diagnose various conditions and provides insight into the body\'s protein profile.',
          'Method of Electrophoresis: Sample Preparation: A small volume of plasma or serum is placed on a support medium such as agarose gel or cellulose acetate. Application of Electric Current: An electric field is applied across the medium. Proteins move according to their net charge and size; negatively charged proteins migrate toward the anode (positive electrode). Separation: Proteins separate into distinct bands: Albumin migrates the farthest due to its high negative charge and smaller size. Globulins follow in the order of α1, α2, β, and γ, based on their charges and sizes. Staining and Detection: The gel is stained to visualize the protein bands. The intensity of each band corresponds to the concentration of the protein fraction. Densitometry: This step quantifies the bands by measuring their optical density, providing precise amounts of each fraction.',
          'Albumin (35-45 g/l): oncotic pressure, bilirubin transport, binding of drugs. Function: Maintains osmotic pressure and acts as a transport protein for hormones, drugs, and other substances. Example: Albumin itself is used as an indicator of nutritional status and liver function. Low albumin levels can indicate liver disease, kidney disease, or malnutrition.',
          'α1-globulin: thyroxine, cortisol, vitamin D transport. Function: These proteins have roles in inflammation and immune responses. Example: α1-antitrypsin is a major α1-globulin that protects tissues from protease enzymes during inflammation. Deficiency can lead to conditions like emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).',
          'α2-globulin: ceruloplasmin (copper), haptoglobin. Function: Involved in various functions, including acute phase responses and transport of specific molecules. Example: Haptoglobin binds free hemoglobin released during hemolysis, preventing iron loss and kidney damage. Elevated levels can indicate inflammation, while low levels may suggest hemolytic anemia.',
          'β-globulin: transferrin (iron). Function: These proteins are primarily involved in iron and lipid transport. Example: Transferrin, a β-globulin, is responsible for iron transport in the blood. Low transferrin levels may indicate liver disease or protein malnutrition, while high levels can be a sign of iron deficiency.',
          'γ-globulin: antibodies. Function: These are immunoglobulins (antibodies) that play a key role in the body\'s immune response. Example: Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the most common γ-globulin and is critical for long-term immunity and fighting bacterial and viral infections. Abnormal levels can be associated with immune deficiencies, chronic infections, or conditions like multiple myeloma.',
          'Fibrinogen: blood coagulation. Function: Plays a key role in blood clotting. Fibrinogen is converted into fibrin by thrombin during the coagulation cascade, forming a mesh that stabilizes blood clots. Example: Fibrinogen itself, which is essential for preventing excessive bleeding. Elevated levels can indicate inflammation, while low levels may point to liver disease or a bleeding disorder.'
