        'Invasive Method - Catheter + Pressure Transducer: A catheter is inserted into an artery (commonly the radial or femoral artery). The catheter is connected to a fluid-filled tubing system linked to an external pressure transducer. The transducer converts the mechanical pressure from blood flow into an electrical signal, which is displayed as a waveform on a monitor.',
        'Invasive Method - Direct Measurement: Provides real-time, continuous monitoring of blood pressure. Highly precise, as it measures the actual pressure inside the artery. Displays systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, and allows for detailed analysis of pulse pressure and waveform morphology.',

        'Non-Invasive Method - Sphygmomanometry: A cuff is placed around the upper arm (or sometimes another limb). The cuff is inflated above systolic pressure, temporarily occluding blood flow in the brachial artery. As the cuff deflates, blood flow resumes, and Korotkoff sounds are detected using a stethoscope or a digital sensor.',

      ],

      examAnswer: 'The invasive method uses a catheter inserted into an artery, commonly the radial or femoral artery, connected to fluid-filled tubing and an external pressure transducer. The transducer converts mechanical pressure into an electrical signal displayed as a continuous waveform, providing real-time measurements of systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure. This method is used in critical care settings for unstable patients requiring moment-to-moment monitoring. Advantages include high accuracy, continuous monitoring, and ability to sample arterial blood gases. Disadvantages include risks of infection, bleeding, arterial damage, and need for trained personnel. The non-invasive method, sphygmomanometry, uses a cuff inflated above systolic pressure to occlude the brachial artery. As the cuff deflates, Korotkoff sounds are detected using either a stethoscope in the auscultatory method or a digital sensor in the oscillometric method. Systolic pressure is recorded when the first Korotkoff sound is heard, and diastolic pressure when sounds disappear. This method is simple, widely available with no significant patient risk, but less accurate than invasive methods, especially in arrhythmias or very low pressures.'

      examAnswer: 'Increased stroke volume causes systolic pressure to increase because more blood is ejected into the aorta, diastolic pressure to remain unchanged or slightly increase, mean arterial pressure to increase, and pulse pressure to increase because systolic rises more than diastolic. Decreased stroke volume produces opposite effects: decreased systolic, decreased pulse pressure, decreased MAP, and unchanged or slightly decreased diastolic. Decreased arterial compliance, as occurs with aging and arteriosclerosis, causes systolic pressure to increase because stiffer arteries cannot absorb the pressure rise, diastolic pressure to decrease due to less elastic recoil during diastole, mean arterial pressure to show slight increase or remain unchanged, and pulse pressure to markedly increase. Increased compliance produces opposite effects: decreased systolic, increased diastolic, decreased pulse pressure, and unchanged MAP. Increased total peripheral resistance from vasoconstriction causes systolic pressure to increase, diastolic pressure to markedly increase because there is less runoff from arteries during diastole, mean arterial pressure to increase, and pulse pressure to decrease. Decreased total peripheral resistance from vasodilation causes systolic pressure to decrease or remain unchanged, diastolic pressure to decrease, mean arterial pressure to decrease, and pulse pressure to increase because systolic is relatively preserved while diastolic falls.'

Pulse wave velocity is three to five meters per second in the aorta and fifteen to thirty meters per second in small arteries, faster in stiffer arteries and slower in compliant arteries. As the pressure pulse moves from aorta to peripheral arteries, the waveform undergoes characteristic changes. Systolic pressure increases due to wave reflection from peripheral sites adding to the forward wave and reduced compliance where stiffer peripheral arteries expand less for a given blood volume. Diastolic pressure remains similar or slightly lower, leading to widened pulse pressure peripherally. The waveform becomes sharper and more peaked in peripheral arteries, while in the aorta it is smoother and more rounded due to compliance. The dicrotic notch disappears, a diastolic peak appears, and the systolic peak occurs slightly later peripherally. In contrast, the flow pulse represents actual blood movement.
