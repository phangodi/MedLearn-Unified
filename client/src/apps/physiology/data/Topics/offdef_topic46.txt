  'Autoregulation: the intrinsic ability of an organ or tissue to maintain constant blood flow despite changes in perfusion pressure (typically within a MAP range of 60–160 mmHg). This ensures stable oxygen and nutrient delivery under varying systemic pressures.',
  'Short-Term Autoregulatory Responses: occur within seconds to minutes, and primarily involve local vascular adjustments. Myogenic Response: vascular smooth muscle contracts in response to increased intraluminal pressure (stretch). Mechanism: stretch-activated ion channels → Ca²⁺ influx → contraction. Maintains constant flow by increasing resistance when pressure rises. Metabolic (Local) Regulation: ↓ Blood flow → accumulation of vasodilator metabolites (e.g. adenosine, CO₂, H⁺, K⁺, low O₂). These cause vasodilation, restoring flow to match local tissue demand. Especially important in brain, heart, skeletal muscle. Shear Stress–Induced Vasodilation: ↑ Flow → ↑ endothelial shear → NO release → vasodilation.',
  'Long-Term Autoregulatory Responses: occur over days to weeks and involve structural adaptation of the vasculature. Angiogenesis: Formation of new capillaries in response to chronic low perfusion (e.g. in skeletal muscle during training or ischemia). Vascular Remodeling: Existing vessels undergo structural changes (e.g. increased diameter) to normalize wall shear stress and flow. Mediated by growth factors (e.g. VEGF, FGF) and chronic hypoxia signals.'

  'Resting tone: the baseline level of contraction in vascular smooth muscle under normal physiological conditions. It determines the vessel\'s diameter and thus its resistance to flow. Importantly, resting tone is not zero — vessels are partially constricted at rest to allow for dynamic regulation. Resting tone is composed of two main components: Basal tone: Arises from intrinsic activity of the smooth muscle. Includes myogenic tone, local endothelial factors (e.g. nitric oxide, endothelin), and metabolic influences. Neurogenic tone: Derived from sympathetic nervous system activity, primarily via α₁-adrenergic receptors. Allows central control over vascular resistance.',
  'Myogenic tone: the vascular smooth muscle\'s intrinsic response to stretch — a key part of autoregulation. When intravascular pressure increases, arteriolar walls are stretched. This triggers stretch-activated ion channels, allowing Ca²⁺ influx, which causes contraction of the smooth muscle (vasoconstriction). Increased pressure → vascular stretch → Ca²⁺ influx → MLCK activation → smooth muscle contraction → vasoconstriction → blood flow stabilized. This limits the increase in blood flow, despite higher pressure. When pressure falls, the opposite occurs: less stretch → relaxation → vasodilation → maintains flow. This pressure-sensitive mechanism: Helps stabilize local tissue perfusion. Operates independently of nerves or hormones. Is especially important in organs requiring constant flow, such as the brain, kidney, and heart.',
  'Bayliss Effect: a specific myogenic response where arterioles constrict in response to increased pressure/stretch and dilate when pressure/stretch decreases. Mechanism: Stretch-Sensitive Ion Channels: An increase in intraluminal pressure stretches the arteriolar wall, activating mechanosensitive ion channels in smooth muscle cells. This causes calcium influx, leading to smooth muscle contraction and vasoconstriction. Conversely, a drop in pressure decreases wall stretch, reducing calcium influx and causing vasodilation. Function: Stabilizes blood flow by counteracting changes in pressure (e.g., maintaining constant flow in cerebral or renal circulation despite systemic pressure fluctuations). Prevents overperfusion when blood pressure rises and maintains flow during hypotensive states.'

  'Metabolic regulation of blood flow: the process by which local blood flow adjusts in response to the metabolic needs of tissues. The theory posits that an imbalance between oxygen delivery and metabolic demand leads to the accumulation of metabolic by-products, which act as vasodilators to increase blood flow.',
  'Active Hyperemia: the increase in blood flow to tissues in response to heightened metabolic activity, such as during exercise or organ function. Mechanism: Increased Metabolic Activity: During activities like exercise, tissues consume more oxygen (O₂) and produce more metabolic by-products (e.g., CO₂, H⁺, lactate, adenosine, prostaglandins, and K⁺ ions). Accumulation of Metabolic By-Products: These metabolites act as vasodilators, causing relaxation of vascular smooth muscle and dilation of arterioles. Increased Blood Flow: The vasodilation increases local blood flow, delivering more oxygen and nutrients to the tissue and removing metabolic waste. Purpose: Ensures that oxygen delivery matches the increased metabolic demand of active tissues. Examples: Increased blood flow to skeletal muscles during exercise. Increased blood flow to the gastrointestinal tract after a meal to support digestion.',
  'Reactive Hyperemia: the transient increase in blood flow to tissues following a period of ischemia (reduced or blocked blood flow). Mechanism: Temporary Ischemia: Ischemia causes a reduction in oxygen supply while metabolic by-products (e.g., CO₂, H⁺, and adenosine) accumulate in the tissue. Release of Ischemia: Once the obstruction is removed or ischemia resolves, the accumulated metabolites stimulate arteriolar vasodilation. Surge in Blood Flow: Blood flow temporarily exceeds baseline levels to restore oxygen balance, clear accumulated metabolites, and repay the "oxygen debt." Purpose: Restores tissue perfusion and removes excess metabolic waste after ischemia. Examples: Increased blood flow to a limb after releasing a tourniquet. Restored perfusion to an organ after unclamping an artery during surgery.',
  'Partial Pressure of Oxygen (PO₂): Mechanism: Low PO₂ (hypoxia) in tissues stimulates the release of vasodilators (e.g., adenosine, nitric oxide) from endothelial cells and parenchymal cells. Effect: Hypoxia-induced vasodilation increases blood flow to restore oxygen delivery.',
  'Partial Pressure of Carbon Dioxide (PCO₂): Mechanism: Elevated PCO₂ (hypercapnia) in tissues causes vasodilation, likely mediated by its effect on lowering pH. Effect: Promotes increased blood flow to remove CO₂ and restore acid-base balance. Example: PCO₂-mediated vasodilation is especially important in cerebral circulation.',
  'pH (Acidosis): Mechanism: Acidosis (low pH) results from increased production of hydrogen ions (H⁺) during anaerobic metabolism or CO₂ accumulation. H⁺ ions directly relax vascular smooth muscle and enhance the effects of other vasodilators (e.g., adenosine). Effect: Acidosis leads to vasodilation, increasing blood flow to buffer and clear excess acid.',
  'Adenosine: Mechanism: Adenosine is released by hypoxic tissues as ATP is broken down to AMP and adenosine. It binds to A2 receptors on vascular smooth muscle, activating adenylate cyclase and increasing cyclic AMP (cAMP). Effect: Promotes smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation. Example: Plays a significant role in coronary blood flow regulation during myocardial hypoxia.',
  'Prostaglandin E2 (PGE₂): Mechanism: PGE₂ is synthesized from arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in response to tissue stress or inflammation. Acts on specific receptors (EP receptors) on vascular smooth muscle to increase cAMP. Effect: Causes vasodilation, enhancing local blood flow. Example: Contributes to hyperemia in inflamed or injured tissues.',
  'Potassium Ions (K⁺): Mechanism: During increased tissue activity, repetitive action potentials cause K⁺ to accumulate in the extracellular space. Elevated K⁺ levels hyperpolarize vascular smooth muscle cells by activating inward-rectifier potassium channels. Effect: Hyperpolarization decreases calcium influx, relaxing smooth muscle and causing vasodilation.'

  'Angiogenesis: the process by which new blood vessels are formed from pre-existing vessels, such as post-capillary venules. This process is crucial for tissue growth, repair, and adaptation to changing metabolic needs. It occurs in both physiological and pathological conditions.',
  'Stimulus for Angiogenesis: Angiogenesis is primarily stimulated by hypoxia (low oxygen levels) and other conditions that increase tissue metabolic demand relative to blood supply. Key factors include: Hypoxia-Inducible Factor-1 (HIF-1): Hypoxia activates HIF-1, a transcription factor that promotes the expression of pro-angiogenic factors like vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Pro-Angiogenic Signals: VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor): The most potent stimulator of angiogenesis, promoting endothelial cell proliferation and migration. Fibroblast Growth Factors (FGFs): Stimulate endothelial and fibroblast proliferation. Platelet-Derived Growth Factor (PDGF): Supports the recruitment of pericytes and smooth muscle cells. Angiopoietins (Ang1 and Ang2): Regulate vessel remodeling and stabilization.',
  'Steps of Angiogenesis (Starting at the Post-Capillary Venule) - Activation Phase: Stimulus Detection: Hypoxia or increased metabolic demand in tissues triggers the release of VEGF and other pro-angiogenic factors from nearby cells, such as fibroblasts, macrophages, and endothelial cells. Endothelial Cell Activation: VEGF binds to its receptor (VEGFR-2) on endothelial cells, activating intracellular signaling pathways (e.g., PI3K-Akt and MAPK pathways).',
  'Steps of Angiogenesis - Degradation of the Basement Membrane: Extracellular Matrix Breakdown: Activated endothelial cells secrete matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which degrade the basement membrane and extracellular matrix surrounding the vessel. This allows endothelial cells to migrate into the surrounding tissue.',
  'Steps of Angiogenesis - Endothelial Cell Migration and Proliferation: Endothelial Sprouting: Tip cells (specialized migratory endothelial cells) extend filopodia toward the VEGF gradient to guide the new vessel\'s growth. Stalk cells (proliferative endothelial cells) follow the tip cells, forming the vessel\'s body. Anastomosis: Sprouting endothelial cells from neighboring vessels fuse, forming continuous vascular loops.',
  'Steps of Angiogenesis - Vessel Maturation: Recruitment of Support Cells: Pericytes and smooth muscle cells are recruited to stabilize the new vessel. Angiopoietin-1 (Ang1) and PDGF mediate this process. Lumen Formation: Endothelial cells reorganize to form a central lumen for blood flow. Stabilization: The basement membrane is re-deposited, and the vessel wall is strengthened.',
  'Long-Term Role of Angiogenesis: Angiogenesis plays a crucial role in the long-term adaptation of blood flow to meet tissue metabolic needs. Tissue Growth and Development: In growing tissues, angiogenesis ensures that blood vessels proliferate to supply oxygen and nutrients to expanding areas. Adaptation to Increased Metabolic Demand: Exercise Training: In skeletal muscles, chronic exercise induces angiogenesis, increasing capillary density and enhancing oxygen delivery. Wound Healing: Angiogenesis restores blood supply to injured tissues, facilitating repair and regeneration. Response to Hypoxia: In conditions of chronic hypoxia (e.g., high altitude, anemia), angiogenesis increases vascular density to improve oxygen delivery. Pathological Angiogenesis: In diseases such as cancer, tumors exploit angiogenesis to secure a blood supply for their growth and metastasis. VEGF is often overexpressed in tumors.'

  'Inflammatory hyperemia: the localized increase in blood flow to tissues as part of the inflammatory response. This process is mediated by the release of various vasoactive substances, including histamine, bradykinin, prostanoids, and neuropeptides, which cause vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and recruitment of immune cells to the site of injury or infection.',
  'Histamine (from Mast Cells): Source: Histamine is released by mast cells in response to injury, allergens, or immune activation. Mechanism: Binds to H1 receptors on vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle. Causes vasodilation by promoting nitric oxide (NO) release. Increases vascular permeability by contracting endothelial cells, creating gaps for plasma and immune cells to escape into the tissue. Effect: Results in redness (erythema) and swelling (edema) characteristic of inflammation.',
  'Bradykinin: Source: Generated from kininogen by the enzyme kallikrein during tissue injury or inflammation. Mechanism: Binds to B2 receptors on endothelial cells, stimulating NO and prostacyclin (PGI₂) production. Activates sensory nerves, enhancing neuropeptide release (e.g., Substance P, CGRP). Effect: Potent vasodilator that increases blood flow and vascular permeability, contributing to pain and redness.',
  'Prostanoids (Prostaglandins): Source: Derived from arachidonic acid through the action of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes. Mechanism: Prostaglandin E2 (PGE₂) and prostacyclin (PGI₂) act on their receptors (EP and IP) on vascular smooth muscle cells, increasing cAMP and causing relaxation. Amplify the effects of bradykinin and histamine. Effect: Maintain vasodilation during inflammation and sensitize nociceptors to pain stimuli.',
  'Neuropeptides (Substance P and CGRP): Source: Released from polymodal nociceptors during tissue injury or activation. Mechanism: Substance P: Acts on NK1 receptors to increase vascular permeability and stimulate mast cells to release histamine. Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide (CGRP): Acts on CGRP receptors to directly induce vasodilation. Effect: Contribute to neurogenic inflammation by promoting hyperemia, plasma extravasation, and immune cell recruitment.',
  'Triple Response of the Skin: a hallmark reaction to mechanical, thermal, or chemical stimuli and involves three distinct phases. Components: Red Line (Local Erythema): Appears immediately at the site of stimulus. Caused by direct vasodilation of capillaries due to histamine release and axon reflex activation. Flare (Diffuse Redness Surrounding the Stimulus): Spreads beyond the initial site of injury. Mediated by the axon reflex, where activated nociceptive nerve endings release neuropeptides (e.g., Substance P, CGRP), causing widespread vasodilation. Wheal (Localized Swelling): Forms within a few minutes at the site of stimulus. Caused by increased vascular permeability due to histamine, allowing plasma and proteins to leak into the interstitial space.',
  'Axon Reflex in the Triple Response: The axon reflex is a local, neurogenic response that does not involve the central nervous system. When polymodal nociceptors are stimulated: Impulses travel antidromically (backward) along adjacent branches of the same sensory neuron. Neuropeptides (Substance P, CGRP) are released, leading to vasodilation (flare) and plasma extravasation (wheal). Axon Reflex Mechanism: A local reflex involving nociceptive (pain) afferent fibers, particularly C fibers. Does not involve the spinal cord or brain. Mechanical stimulation → activates nociceptors. The afferent impulse travels antidromically (backward along adjacent branches of the same axon). These branches release vasoactive neuropeptides: Substance P and Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP). These cause vasodilation of arterioles around the injury → flare.'
