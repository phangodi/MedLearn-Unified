        'Nitric Oxide (NO): Nitric oxide (NO) is a potent endogenous vasodilator that primarily affects vascular smooth muscle cells. When inhaled, it has selective effects on the pulmonary circulation due to its short half-life and localised action.',
        'Mechanism of Action of Inhaled NO: Vascular Target: Inhaled NO diffuses across the alveolar-capillary membrane and acts on pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells near well-ventilated alveoli. Signal Transduction: NO activates soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) in smooth muscle cells. This increases the intracellular concentration of cyclic GMP (cGMP). Elevated cGMP causes relaxation of smooth muscle cells, leading to vasodilation. Selective Action: Because NO is rapidly inactivated by haemoglobin in the blood, its effects are limited to the pulmonary circulation. This minimizes systemic vasodilation.',
        'Effect on Hypoxic Vasoconstriction (HPV): Reduction of Local Vasoconstriction: Hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV) is a compensatory mechanism that redirects blood flow from poorly ventilated (hypoxic) alveoli to better-ventilated regions. Inhaled NO selectively dilates pulmonary vessels in ventilated regions, counteracting HPV. Improved Ventilation-Perfusion Matching: Inhaled NO enhances blood flow to well-ventilated alveoli, optimizing oxygenation. This reduces intrapulmonary shunting and improves arterial oxygenation.',
        'Effect on Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR): Decreased PVR in Ventilated Regions: NO lowers PVR in well-ventilated lung areas by relaxing pulmonary arterioles. This can alleviate pulmonary hypertension caused by increased PVR. Selective Action Preserves HPV in Non-Ventilated Regions: NO does not affect non-ventilated regions because it cannot diffuse to poorly ventilated alveoli. This selective action helps preserve the beneficial effects of HPV in directing blood away from hypoxic regions.'

        'Bronchial Circulation: The bronchial circulation is a part of the systemic circulation that supplies oxygenated blood to the airways and supporting structures of the lungs. Unlike the pulmonary circulation, which primarily participates in gas exchange, the bronchial circulation serves the metabolic needs of lung tissue.',
        'Origin of Bronchial Arteries: The bronchial arteries originate from the systemic circulation, usually arising from: The descending thoracic aorta (most common). Occasionally, from intercostal arteries or the subclavian arteries.',

Pulmonary veins, where some bronchial venous blood is shunted and contributes to the normal physiological shunt.',

        'Anastomoses with Pulmonary Circulation: Bronchial and pulmonary circulations are interconnected via anastomoses. These anastomoses ensure perfusion to lung tissue even if one of the circulations is compromised.',
        'Functions of the Bronchial Circulation: Nutritional Supply: Provides oxygen and nutrients to: Conducting airways (trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles). Supporting tissues of the lung, including the connective tissue and pleura. Thermoregulation: Helps in maintaining the temperature of inspired air by warming it. Humidification of Inspired Air: Plays a role in the humidification of air passing through the airways. Defense Mechanism: Contributes to immune defense by delivering immune cells and mediators to the airways. Collateral Circulation: During pulmonary artery obstruction (e.g., pulmonary embolism), bronchial circulation can partially maintain perfusion to lung tissue, preventing ischemia.'
