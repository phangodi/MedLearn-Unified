The chloride that enters the cell is recycled back into the lumen through CFTR - the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator - chloride channels, maintaining a continuous supply of chloride for the exchanger. The hydrogen ions produced intracellularly are exported across the basolateral membrane in exchange for sodium via the sodium-hydrogen exchanger. Sodium then enters the duct lumen paracellularly through tight junctions, driven by the negative luminal voltage. Water follows osmotically, forming an isosmotic bicarbonate solution. During maximal stimulation by secretin, bicarbonate concentrations can reach up to one hundred forty-five milliequivalents per liter.'
