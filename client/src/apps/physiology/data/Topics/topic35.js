        'Frank-Starling law statement: the force of contraction of the cardiac muscle is directly proportional to the initial length of the muscle fibers (i.e., the degree of stretch) at the end of diastole. In other words, within physiological limits, the more the heart muscle is stretched during filling (greater preload), the stronger the force of contraction and the greater the volume of blood ejected (stroke volume). When the heart receives more blood during diastole (increased preload), the myocardial fibers are stretched, leading to optimal overlap of actin and myosin filaments. This results in a stronger contraction during systole. This intrinsic property ensures that the heart can match its output to the volume of blood returned to it, maintaining equilibrium between the input and output of the heart.',
