// **LO-1** (Topic-67) - Macroscopic and microscopic architecture; unstirred water layer
officialDefinitions: [
  'Folds of Kerckring (plicae circulares): large, circular folds of the intestinal mucosa that increase the surface area for nutrient absorption.',
  'Villi: fingerlike projections extending from these folds, further amplify the absorptive surface. They are longest in the duodenum, where most digestion and absorption occur, and shortest in the terminal ileum.',
  'Enterocytes (epithelial cells) that line the villi contain microvilli, which form a structure called the brush border. The brush border increases the absorptive surface area and contains enzymes essential for the final steps of digestion.',
  'Goblet cells interspersed among the enterocytes secrete mucus, which protects the intestinal lining.',
  'Surface area expansion: The combination of folds of Kerckring, villi, and microvilli increases the total surface area by approximately 600 times, maximizing nutrient absorption. The total area of the human adult gut mucosa is around 32 m², from which 30 is the small intestine and 2 the colon contribution.',
  'Unstirred water layer: a thin layer of water covering the brush-border surface of the enterocytes from the intestinal lumen. The microvilli provide not only large surface, but also special microenvironment: the last steps of digestion take place by the enzymes secreted into the unstirred water layer created by the glycocalyx thus enabling fast absorption.',
  'Unstirred water layer functions: It slows down the diffusion of hydrophilic molecules, allowing digestive enzymes secreted into the glycocalyx (a protective carbohydrate-rich coating) to break down nutrients. The enzymes present in the brush border function optimally in this layer, allowing the final digestion of carbohydrates and proteins. The unstirred layer also plays a role in the absorption of lipids, as bile salts form micelles that diffuse through this layer to deliver fatty acids and monoglycerides for uptake by enterocytes. The unstirred water layer is slightly acidic, enabling passive diffusion of fatty acid anions.',

// **LO-2** (Topic-67) - Renewal of GI cells; barrier and selective gate
officialDefinitions: [
  'Epithelial renewal rate is high, the mature enterocyte "lives" only ~1-2 days before shedding off. The entire intestinal mucosa is renewed every 3–6 days, ensuring a continuous replenishment of absorptive cells.',
  'Villus cell types: Enterocyte (digestion and absorption); Goblet cell (protective mucin secretion).',
  'Crypt (Lieberkühn-crypt) cell types: Mitotic stem cells (source of new enterocytes); Secretory glandular cells; Paneth-cells (protective immune functions).',
  'Fluid secretion and absorption are restricted to different compartments: secretion in the Lieberkühn-crypts, absorption in the villi.',
  'Barrier function: The intestinal epithelium prevents harmful toxins, pathogens, and undigested food particles from entering the bloodstream. Tight junctions between epithelial cells regulate the permeability of the intestinal wall, limiting the entry of large or harmful molecules. The mucus layer secreted by goblet cells adds another protective layer by trapping bacteria and reducing damage from digestive enzymes.',
  'Transcellular pathway (cellular route): Substances (nutrients, electrolytes, water) cross the apical membrane of enterocytes, move through the cytoplasm, and then exit via the basolateral membrane into the blood. This pathway is regulated by specific transporters, ensuring selective absorption of essential nutrients.',
  'Paracellular pathway: Substances move between adjacent epithelial cells via tight junctions into the blood. This pathway is permeability-dependent and varies along the intestine: higher permeability in the jejunum, lower in the colon to control water and electrolyte balance.',

// **LO-3** (Topic-67) - Sequential starch digestion; carbohydrate membrane transport
officialDefinitions: [
  'Salivary α-amylase (ptyalin): Digestion begins in the mouth with α-amylase secreted in saliva. It hydrolyzes α-1,4 glycosidic bonds in starch, producing maltose, maltotriose, and α-limit dextrins. Salivary amylase is responsible for 10-15% of the chemical breakdown of carbohydrates. Its activity is halted once food reaches the stomach due to the acidic environment (salivary amylase is inactivated by gastric acid).',
  'Pancreatic amylase: Acinar cells secrete pancreatic amylase which hydrolyses α-1,4 glycosidic bonds, producing maltose, maltotriose, and α-limit dextrins. This enzyme works at an optimal neutral to slightly alkaline pH, provided by bicarbonate secretion. CCK stimulates acinar cells to produce pancreatic amylase and relaxes the Sphincter of Oddi for ejection to the duodenum.',
  'Brush border enzymes (intestinal apical membrane): Disaccharidases (lactase, maltase-glucoamylase, sucrase, isomaltase, trehalase). Lactase breaks down lactose into glucose and galactose. Maltase (glucoamylase) hydrolyzes maltose and maltotriose into glucose. Sucrase-isomaltase: sucrase breaks down sucrose into glucose and fructose; isomaltase targets α-1,6 glycosidic bonds in α-limit dextrins → glucose. Final products of carbohydrate digestion: three main monosaccharides: glucose, galactose, and fructose.',
  'Apical membrane transport (lumen → enterocyte): Glucose and galactose enter enterocytes via SGLT1 (Sodium-Glucose Linked Transporter 1) — secondary active transport dependent on the Na⁺ gradient created by the Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase on the basolateral membrane. Fructose is absorbed by facilitated diffusion using the GLUT5 transporter.',
  'Basolateral membrane transport (enterocyte → blood): Glucose, galactose, and fructose all exit the enterocyte via GLUT2 transporter through facilitated diffusion. From there they enter the hepatic portal vein to the liver.',

// **LO-4** (Topic-67) - Sequential protein digestion; membrane transport (CRITICAL)
officialDefinitions: [
  'Overview: The digestion of protein begins in the stomach with the action of pepsin and is completed in the small intestine with pancreatic and brush-border proteases. The two classes of proteases are endopeptidases and exopeptidases. Endopeptidases hydrolyze the interior peptide bonds of proteins; the endopeptidases of the gastrointestinal tract are pepsin, trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase. Exopeptidases hydrolyze one amino acid at a time from the C-terminal ends of proteins and peptides; the exopeptidases of the gastrointestinal tract are carboxypeptidases A and B.',
  'Gastric digestion — Pepsin: Protein digestion begins in the stomach with pepsin, which is secreted by the gastric chief cells as an inactive precursor, pepsinogen. Pepsinogen is activated into pepsin by the acidic environment (pH 1–3) created by HCl secreted by the parietal cells. Pepsin is an endopeptidase that hydrolyzes internal peptide bonds within protein molecules, breaking them down into smaller polypeptides, proteoses, and peptones. Pepsin is particularly important in digesting collagen. Pepsin is only responsible for about 10–20% of total protein digestion and is inactivated when it reaches the duodenum, where pancreatic bicarbonate neutralizes gastric acid.',
  'Pancreatic enzymes: Trypsinogen is converted to trypsin by the brush-border enzyme enterokinase (enteropeptidase). Trypsin then activates chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, and procarboxypeptidases A/B into their active forms. Trypsin: endopeptidase that cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl side where there are lysine and arginine → tripeptide, dipeptide. Chymotrypsin: endopeptidase that cleaves peptide bonds on the carboxyl side where there are tyrosine, phenylalanine, tryptophan → tripeptide, dipeptide. Elastase: cleaves bonds from the C-terminal end → amino acids, dipeptide, tripeptide. Carboxypeptidases A and B: exopeptidases that remove single amino acids from the C-terminal end of peptides → amino acids, dipeptide, tripeptide.',
  'Brush border enzymes (intestinal apical membrane): Aminopeptidases cleave single amino acids from the N-terminal end of peptides (N-terminus) → amino acids. Dipeptidases break down dipeptides → amino acids.',
  'Apical membrane transport mechanisms: Free amino acids are transported via Na⁺/AA cotransporters (secondary active transport: sodium gradient drives amino acid uptake). Di- and tripeptides are transported via PEPT1 (H⁺/dipeptide and H⁺/tripeptide cotransporters) — an active process driven by a proton gradient. The proton gradient is maintained by the Na⁺/H⁺ antiporter (NHE) on the apical membrane.',
  'Intracellular handling: Intracellular peptidases in the enterocyte cytoplasm cleave absorbed dipeptides and tripeptides → free amino acids.',
  'Basolateral membrane transport: Amino acids move out of the enterocyte through facilitated diffusion via basolateral amino acid transporters → capillaries → veins → hepatic portal vein → liver for protein synthesis.',

// **LO-5** (Topic-67) - Lipid solubilization, digestion, uptake and processing (CRITICAL)
officialDefinitions: [
  'Overview: The dietary lipids include triglycerides (>90% of dietary fat), cholesterol esters, and phospholipids. A factor that greatly complicates lipid digestion and absorption is their insolubility in water (their hydrophobicity). Because the gastrointestinal tract is filled with an aqueous fluid, the lipids must somehow be solubilized to be digested and absorbed.',
  'Initial lipid digestion: Lingual lipase is secreted by sublingual and parotid salivary glands; gastric lipase is secreted by chief cells. Both hydrolyze triglycerides (TAGs) into monoglycerides (MAGs) and free fatty acids (FFAs). Gastric lipase plays only a minor role, digesting less than 10% of dietary fats.',
  'Emulsification by bile salts and lecithin: Bile salts and lecithin (a phospholipid) are amphipathic molecules that act as detergents surrounding large lipid droplets and breaking them into smaller droplets. This increases the total surface area, allowing better enzyme access. Emulsification does not involve enzymatic digestion, but it prepares lipids for enzyme action.',
  'Pancreatic lipase (main enzyme for triglycerides): Secreted in active form. Hydrolyzes triglycerides into monoglycerides and free fatty acids. Bile salts coat the lipid droplets, preventing pancreatic lipase from binding. The pancreas secretes colipase as an inactive precursor (procolipase), activated by trypsin. Colipase displaces bile salts, allowing pancreatic lipase to bind to the lipid-water interface and digest triglycerides.',
  'Phospholipase A2 (PLA2): Secreted as inactive proenzyme, activated by trypsin. Hydrolyzes phospholipids (e.g., lecithin) into lysolecithin and fatty acids. Cholesterol ester hydrolase (CEH): hydrolyzes cholesterol esters into free cholesterol and fatty acids.',
  'Micelle formation — key to solubilizing lipids: End products of lipid digestion (monoglycerides, FFAs, cholesterol, lysolecithin) are hydrophobic and incorporated into micelles formed by bile salts. Micelles: bile salts + cholesterol + phospholipids. Core: hydrophobic lipid digestion products. Outer layer: amphipathic bile salts. Micelles are small disks that act as shuttles transporting lipids to the brush-border membrane of enterocytes. Micelle formation is required for absorption. Short and medium chain (C<14) FAs do not form micelles — free diffusion.',
  'Uptake by enterocytes: Micelles of bile salts and products of lipid digestion diffuse through the unstirred layer. The hydrophobic nature of lipid digestion products allows them to passively diffuse across the lipid bilayer of enterocytes. Micelles do not enter the cells — they remain in the lumen and their lipid contents are released at the brush border. Bile salts are left behind and reabsorbed later in the ileum via the enterohepatic circulation. At the enterocyte — unstirred water layer acidic pH: FA anion + H⁺ — diffusion into the enterocytes.',
  'Re-esterification inside the enterocyte (smooth endoplasmic reticulum): Monoglycerides (MAGs) and Free Fatty Acids (FFAs) are re-esterified into triglycerides (TAGs). Cholesterol and Free Fatty Acids are re-esterified into cholesterol esters. Lysolecithin and Fatty Acids are re-esterified into phospholipids. Lipids are re-synthesized from FA, cholesterol and MG.',
  'Packaging and release: Newly synthesized lipids are packaged into chylomicrons in the Golgi apparatus. Apolipoprotein B-48 (synthesized by enterocytes) is incorporated into the chylomicron surface. Chylomicrons are enclosed in secretory vesicles, transported to the basolateral membrane, and released by exocytosis. Lipids are incorporated in chylomicrons and transported by the lymph.',

// **LO-6** (Topic-67) - Chylomicron composition, formation, route into cardiovascular system
officialDefinitions: [
  'Composition of chylomicrons: Chylomicrons are large lipoprotein particles responsible for transporting dietary lipids from the intestines to the bloodstream. Protein content: 1.5-2.5%, lipid content: 97-99%, main apoprotein: Apo B-48 (synthesized by enterocytes). Core (hydrophobic interior): triglycerides (85-90%) — the primary lipid component; cholesterol esters. Outer layer (amphipathic surface): phospholipids — form a monolayer stabilizing the particle; Apo B-48 (apoproteins) — facilitate chylomicron function and metabolism; unesterified (free) cholesterol — interspersed within the phospholipid monolayer.',
  'Formation of chylomicrons in enterocytes: Step 1 — Uptake: fatty acids, monoglycerides, cholesterol, and lysolecithin enter enterocytes via passive diffusion across the brush-border membrane and are transported to the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER). Step 2 — Re-esterification in SER: MAG + FFA → reconvert to TG (by monoacylglycerol-acyltransferase and diacylglycerol-acyltransferase); cholesterol + FFA → reconvert to cholesterol esters; lysolecithin + fatty acid → phospholipids. Step 3 — Assembly in Golgi: newly synthesized lipids combine with Apo B-48 (synthesized by rough endoplasmic reticulum) to form chylomicron particles in the Golgi apparatus.',
  'Movement across the enterocyte basolateral membrane: Chylomicrons are enclosed in secretory vesicles and transported to the basolateral membrane. The vesicles fuse with the basolateral membrane and chylomicrons are released into the interstitial space via exocytosis.',
  'Route of entry into the cardiovascular system: Chylomicrons are too large to enter blood capillaries, so they enter lacteals (lymphatic capillaries found in intestinal villi). Chylomicrons move through lacteals → lymphatic vessels → thoracic duct → enter the blood circulation where the left subclavian vein and the left internal jugular vein meet (brachiocephalic veins) → target tissues (skeletal muscles, adipose tissue) and liver.',
  'At target tissues: Lipoprotein lipase located in the capillary endothelium of skeletal muscle and adipose tissue cleaves TG into FFA. FFA enter skeletal muscle as energy source or are stored as TG (lipogenesis) in adipose tissue. Chylomicron remnants are taken up by the liver via receptor-mediated endocytosis.',

// **LO-7** (Topic-67) - Steatorrhea: causes and effects on fat-soluble vitamins
officialDefinitions: [
  'Steatorrhea: refers to the excretion of excessive amounts of fat in the stool. Normally, nearly all ingested fat is absorbed by the small intestine, so visible fat in the stool signals a breakdown in one or more of the steps required for fat digestion and absorption.',
  'Cause 1 — Pancreatic insufficiency: Chronic pancreatitis or cystic fibrosis can impair the pancreas\'s ability to produce digestive enzymes (especially pancreatic lipase). Without sufficient pancreatic lipase, triglycerides are not broken down into absorbable monoglycerides and free fatty acids, leading to fat loss in the stool.',
  'Cause 2 — Bile salt deficiency: Decreased bile salt synthesis (e.g., severe liver disease) or bile salt loss (e.g., ileal resection, Crohn\'s disease affecting the ileum) can reduce micelle formation. If micelles do not form properly, dietary lipids are poorly absorbed and end up in the stool.',
  'Cause 3 — Mucosal abnormalities of the small intestine: Celiac disease, tropical sprue, Crohn\'s disease, or damage from Zollinger-Ellison syndrome can reduce the surface area or damage the brush border, impairing lipid absorption. In Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, excessive gastric acid inactivates pancreatic lipase and injures the duodenal mucosa.',
  'Cause 4 — Other: Bacterial overgrowth can deconjugate bile salts, leading to insufficient micelle formation. Short bowel syndrome after surgical resection drastically reduces the absorptive surface.',
  'Effects on fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K): The fat-soluble vitamins require normal fat digestion and absorption. They are incorporated into micelles in the presence of bile salts, then absorbed into intestinal epithelial cells, packaged into chylomicrons, and delivered to the circulation. When steatorrhea occurs (i.e., when dietary fats are not absorbed properly), these vitamins are also lost in the stool rather than absorbed. Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency leads to: Vitamin A deficiency (night blindness), Vitamin D deficiency (osteomalacia, rickets), Vitamin E deficiency (neuropathy), Vitamin K deficiency (bleeding disorders — impaired synthesis of clotting factors II, VII, IX, X).',

// **LO-8** (Topic-67) - Intestinal absorption of water, electrolytes, iron, calcium
// Reference values: intestinal juice secretion: 2-3 L/day (lecture PDF states 2-4 L/day), intestinal fluid reabsorption: 5-6 L/day
officialDefinitions: [
  'Water absorption: Primarily in the small intestine (jejunum and ileum); additional absorption in the colon. Water absorption is passive and follows the osmotic gradients established by solute (especially Na⁺) absorption. Paracellular route (between cells) is prominent in the small intestine where tight junctions are relatively "leaky." Transcellular route (through cells) is more important in the colon where tight junctions are much "tighter." Nearly 9 L of fluid (from both ingested fluid and secretions) enter the intestinal lumen daily, and all but ~100–200 mL are absorbed. Intestinal juice secretion: 2-3 L/day (learning objectives) / 2-4 L/day (lecture PDF). Intestinal fluid reabsorption: 5-6 L/day. Water absorption can be stimulated by organic solutes + sodium (basis of oral rehydration therapy).',
  'Sodium (Na⁺) absorption: Primarily in the jejunum, continues in the ileum and colon. Mechanism 1 — Na⁺-coupled nutrient transport (jejunum): apical membrane has Na⁺-glucose and Na⁺-amino acid cotransporters; after entering the cell, Na⁺ is pumped out at the basolateral membrane by the Na⁺-K⁺ ATPase. Mechanism 2 — Na⁺/Cl⁻ cotransport (distal jejunum, ileum). Mechanism 3 — Parallel Na⁺-H⁺ and Cl⁻-HCO₃⁻ exchanges (ileum): results in net NaCl absorption. Mechanism 4 — ENaC channels (colon): under influence of aldosterone, Na⁺ enters via epithelial Na⁺ channels (ENaC), then is pumped out by Na⁺-K⁺ ATPase.',
  'Chloride (Cl⁻) absorption: Absorbed throughout the small intestine and colon, often following Na⁺. Follows Na⁺ passively through tight junctions (paracellular route). Absorbed via Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger or Na⁺/Cl⁻ cotransport (especially in ileum/colon). Passive paracellular Cl⁻ transport is facilitated by aldosterone in the colon.',
  'Potassium (K⁺) and Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻): Small intestine — net K⁺ absorption, largely by passive diffusion (paracellular) as water is absorbed and lumen K⁺ rises. Colon — may have net K⁺ secretion, especially if aldosterone is elevated or in diarrhea. Jejunum — net absorption of HCO₃⁻ (H⁺ secreted into lumen recombines with luminal HCO₃⁻ → CO₂ + H₂O, which diffuse back in). Ileum and colon — can secrete HCO₃⁻ in exchange for Cl⁻ (helpful in neutralizing acidic byproducts from bacterial fermentation).',
  'Iron absorption: Location: primarily in the duodenum and upper jejunum. Functional iron (3000 mg) vs. store iron (1000 mg). Daily intake: 10-20 mg/day, absorption: 1-2 mg/day. Forms of iron: inorganic iron (ferro: Fe²⁺ and ferri: Fe³⁺) and heme iron (from hemoglobin or myoglobin). A ferrireductase in the brush border membrane converts Fe³⁺ to Fe²⁺. Fe²⁺ is transported across the apical membrane via H⁺/Fe²⁺ symporter (facilitated diffusion + electrical gradient). Heme iron is taken up by endocytosis and released from the complex by heme-oxygenase inside the cell. Intracellular handling: free Fe²⁺ binds to apoferritin, forming ferritin (storage form). Export to blood: Fe²⁺ is transported across the basolateral membrane via ferroportin (inhibited by hepcidin in chronic inflammation) and enters circulation, where it binds to transferrin. Antioxidants (e.g., vitamin C) promote absorption; phytic acid forms complexes and inhibits absorption.',
  'Calcium absorption: Location: duodenum and proximal jejunum (regulated active transport); also absorbed throughout small intestine (passive). Active transcellular route — regulated by calcitriol (vitamin D₃, 1,25(OH)₂D₃): apical entry via TRPV6 (luminal Ca²⁺ transporter channels); binds to calbindin in the cytosol (calbindin synthesis is induced by vitamin D₃); exported via Ca²⁺-ATPase (PMCA) or Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger on basolateral side. Vitamin D₃ increases synthesis of calbindin and both apical and basolateral transporters. Paracellular (passive, unregulated): driven by concentration gradients.',
