        'High Colloid Osmotic Pressure in Peritubular Capillaries: During filtration at the glomerulus, plasma water leaves, but plasma proteins stay behind. This increases the protein concentration in the capillaries downstream. The high protein concentration creates a strong osmotic pull (about 30-35 mmHg), which pulls water and solutes into the capillaries from the surrounding interstitial space.',
        'Combined Effect on Net Reabsorption: Together, these forces create a net reabsorptive pressure of ~+20 mmHg. This drives reabsorption of about 65-70% of filtered water and solutes from the proximal tubule. Solutes include sodium, chloride, glucose, amino acids, and others.',
        'Glomerulotubular Balance: The intrinsic mechanism by which the proximal tubule adjusts its reabsorption of water and solutes to match the filtered load from the glomerulus. More filtration → more plasma water lost → proteins stay behind → raises oncotic pressure (π) in peritubular capillaries → creates strong suction force, pulling fluid back from the tubule into the capillaries.',
        'Starling Forces in Peritubular Capillaries: Low hydrostatic pressure (~8-12 mmHg) combined with high oncotic pressure (~30-35 mmHg) favors fluid reabsorption rather than filtration, which is the opposite of the glomerular capillaries where high hydrostatic pressure (~60 mmHg) drives filtration.'

        raw: 'Peritubular capillaries have Starling forces favoring reabsorption rather than filtration. Hydrostatic pressure is low at approximately 8 to 12 mmHg because blood exits the glomerulus through the narrow efferent arteriole. This low pressure favors reabsorption from the interstitium. Colloid osmotic pressure is high at approximately 30 to 35 mmHg because glomerular filtration removes water while retaining plasma proteins, concentrating them. This creates strong osmotic pull drawing water and solutes into peritubular capillaries. Together, these forces create net reabsorptive pressure of approximately 20 mmHg, driving reabsorption of 65 to 70% of filtered water and solutes from the proximal tubule including sodium, chloride, glucose, amino acids, and bicarbonate.
