This downward movement creates a negative pressure in the atria, enhancing venous return by drawing blood from the veins into the atria. Mechanics During Diastole: When the ventricles relax during diastole, the valve plane moves upward. This movement aids in filling the ventricles as it increases the atrial pressure, which propels blood into the ventricles.
