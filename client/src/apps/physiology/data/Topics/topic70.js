Sources: occurs exclusively in animal-derived foods (liver is particularly rich, Ito cells store vitamin A; fish oils, dairy products, eggs); plant-based diet can cover need via carotenoids - β-carotene (most important source, in carrots) acts as provitamin A, cleaved into retinal and further reduced to retinol; retinyl esters cleaved in small intestine, incorporated into micelles, absorbed into enterocytes, reesterified, released into lymphatic system as component of chylomicrons, taken up by hepatocytes. Biological significance: rhodopsin component; regulates epithelial growth and differentiation; active form retinoic acid acts via intracellular retinoic acid receptors (RAR); maintains epithelial cell integrity in skin and mucous membranes; antioxidant and immune function. Deficiency symptoms: night blindness (impaired rod function); xerophthalmia (dryness, keratinization, and corneal damage - keratomalacia); dry skin/hyperkeratosis; increased susceptibility to infections; in developing countries where poor populations eat mainly rice.',

Absorption through food is of secondary importance. Synthesis: multi-step process beginning with cholecalciferol; in the liver hydroxylated to 25(OH)D3 (calcidiol); 1α-hydroxylation in the kidney induced by hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or parathyroid hormone → active form 1,25(OH)2D3. Biological significance: increases Ca2+ and PO4− absorption in the intestine; regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis; supports bone mineralization; non-classical effects on immune system, insulin secretion. Deficiency symptoms: Rickets (children - "English disease"): weaker bones, large quantities of osteoid without calcification, osteoclastic absorption of bone → bandy leg, pigeon breast, craniodeformity, dental abnormalities; plasma calcium and phosphate decrease. Osteomalacia (adults): loss of mineral bone substance, severe bone pain, bone fractures. 1,25(OH)2D3 deficiency in chronic kidney failure: hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism.',
        'Vitamin E (Tocopherol): Sources: green vegetables, vegetable oils. Biological significance: antioxidant, protects membrane proteins. Deficiency: myasthenia. Excess: inhibition of the immune system.',

Biological significance: cofactor in γ-carboxylation of glutamate residues of proteins (γ-glutamylcarboxylase); post-translational modification of coagulation factors II, VII, IX and X, and plasma proteins C and S; Matrix Gla protein - primarily inhibits calcification of cartilage and vessels; essential for bone mineralization.

Insoluble fibers - do not dissolve in water and remain largely intact through the digestive tract; absorb water as they move through GI tract; add bulk to stool and help it pass more quickly through the intestines; promote regular bowel movements, prevent constipation.',
        'Biological role - gut motility: fibers enhance peristalsis, reducing constipation and risk of diverticulosis; stretching of the intestinal wall shortens passage time; cellulose broken down by intestinal bacteria (e.g., producing acetate), used for energy requirements; stimulate gastric juice secretion; in the small intestine, slow down the absorption of glucose and cholesterol; insoluble fibers speed up transit time, soluble fibers slow digestion.',

Fermentation produces SCFAs (butyrate, acetate, propionate): provide energy to colon cells, lower inflammation, protect against colorectal cancer (immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory effect against inflammatory bowel diseases, colon carcinoma).
