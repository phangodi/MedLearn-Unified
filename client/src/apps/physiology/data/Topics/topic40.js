During systole, the ventricles contract and eject blood into the aorta and pulmonary artery.

        'Cyclic Variation in Myocardial Flow in the Walls of the Right and Left Ventricles - Right Ventricle (RV): The right ventricular systolic pressure is low (approximately 15-25 mmHg), which means that the coronary arteries supplying the RV wall are not significantly compressed during contraction. Therefore, blood flow in the RV wall occurs relatively evenly during both systole and diastole. During Systole: blood flow occurs relatively evenly. During Diastole: Although the RV coronary perfusion increases during diastole (as in the LV), the difference is less pronounced compared to the left ventricle because systolic compression of the RV coronary vessels is mild. Summary: The RV experiences continuous coronary flow throughout the cardiac cycle, with only a minor dependence on diastolic relaxation.',

During Systole: significant compression of coronary vessels, especially in the subendocardium, reduces or even temporarily halts blood flow. During Diastole: Blood flow to the LV myocardium occurs predominantly during diastole when the ventricular muscle relaxes, and the coronary vessels reopen.

This layer also experiences the greatest wall stress due to its proximity to the cavity pressure and is metabolically more active, requiring more oxygen. During Systole: During systole, the high intramural pressure almost completely occludes the subendocardial vessels, reducing blood flow to nearly zero. This makes the subendocardium highly dependent on diastolic perfusion. During Diastole: During diastole, relaxation of the ventricular wall relieves pressure on the subendocardial vessels, allowing blood flow to resume. Subendocardial flow is highest in early diastole.

During Systole: Although systolic compression affects the subepicardial vessels, it is much less pronounced than in the subendocardium. Some degree of blood flow continues during systole in this layer. During Diastole: Like the subendocardium, blood flow to the subepicardium increases during diastole, but the dependency on diastolic perfusion is less critical because systolic compression is minimal.

Arteriovenous oxygen difference is approximately 114 milliliters per liter, more than double the body average of 50 milliliters per liter. These values are unique because: myocardium relies almost entirely on oxidative metabolism with oxygen extraction already near maximum at rest so cannot significantly increase extraction during stress unlike other organs; heart is continuously active with high constant metabolic demand and disproportionately high oxygen consumption compared to mass; increased oxygen demand must be met by increasing coronary blood flow not extraction since extraction is already near maximal; heart is highly sensitive to ischemia with little reserve capacity for increasing extraction making it vulnerable to conditions like atherosclerosis or tachycardia.<<'

        'Mechanism whereby coronary blood flow is coupled to myocardial workload: Coronary blood flow is tightly matched to the metabolic demands of the myocardium - a process known as metabolic autoregulation. As myocardial workload increases (e.g. during exercise or stress), oxygen consumption rises, but since the heart extracts oxygen near maximally at rest (≈70-80%), the only way to meet increased demand is to increase coronary blood flow. This coupling occurs primarily through local metabolic control, in which changes in myocardial metabolism lead to the release of vasodilator substances that act directly on coronary arterioles.',
        'Steps in Coupling Coronary Blood Flow to Myocardial Workload - Increased Myocardial Oxygen Demand: Myocardial workload rises due to factors like increased heart rate, contractility, and wall stress (as per Laplace\'s law: wall stress increases with greater pressure or volume). This leads to a higher rate of oxygen consumption and the need for increased oxygen delivery to the myocardium.',
        'Steps in Coupling Coronary Blood Flow to Myocardial Workload - Local Hypoxia and Metabolic Signals: As oxygen consumption increases, myocardial PO₂ (partial pressure of oxygen) decreases. This hypoxia, combined with increased workload, stimulates the production of vasodilatory metabolites, such as: Adenosine (from ATP breakdown during hypoxia). Carbon dioxide (CO₂). Hydrogen ions (H⁺) (from lactic acid due to anaerobic metabolism). Potassium ions (K⁺) (released during myocardial depolarizations). Lactate (produced during anaerobic metabolism).',

Adenosine, the most potent vasodilator, binds to A2 receptors, activating adenylyl cyclase, increasing cAMP, and decreasing intracellular calcium levels, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.',
        'Steps in Coupling Coronary Blood Flow to Myocardial Workload - Flow-Mediated Vasodilation: As coronary blood flow increases, shear stress on endothelial cells rises. Shear stress stimulates endothelial cells to release nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator that diffuses into vascular smooth muscle cells, triggering relaxation.',
