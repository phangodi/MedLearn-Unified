  'Sucking: a primitive reflex essential for newborn feeding (brainstem motor reflex in the newborn). Involves coordinated action of the lips, cheeks, tongue, and jaw muscles. A negative pressure is generated in the oral cavity by lowering the tongue and mandible while sealing the lips, drawing fluid into the mouth. Involuntary in neonates that becomes voluntary with development. Controlled by cranial nerves V (trigeminal), VII (facial), IX (glossopharyngeal), X (vagus), and XII (hypoglossal).',
  'Biting: a voluntary motor action that involves the controlled closure of the jaws to break food into smaller pieces. Initiation: voluntary movement controlled by the cerebral cortex and brainstem motor centers. The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) innervates the jaw muscles responsible for biting. Muscular control: the masseter and temporalis muscles contract to close the jaw forcefully; the pterygoid muscles assist in jaw stabilization and positioning. Incisors (front teeth) provide a strong cutting action; molars (back teeth) generate crushing and grinding of food.',
  'Chewing (Mastication): a rhythmic and coordinated motor process involving the teeth, jaw muscles, tongue, and oral structures to break food into smaller particles, mix it with saliva, and prepare it for swallowing. Combines voluntary and reflexive mechanisms. Biting and initiation of chewing is VOLUNTARY, but the process itself is more or less automated. Controlled by a central pattern generator (CPG) / voluntary, and by (proprioceptive), mechanoreceptive and other sensory reflexes.',
  'Chewing mechanism: rhythmic opening and closing of the mandible using jaw muscles (masseter, pterygoids, temporalis). Involves movement of the tongue, buccinator, and lips to position food. Sensory receptors involved: muscle spindles and periodontal membrane receptors. Neural control: mastication center in the brainstem (rhythm generator → muscular contraction pattern generator → motor nerve), with inputs from the motor area/mastication area of the cortex, thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, prefrontal area, and basal nucleus. Masseteric reflex provides proprioceptive feedback.',
  'Significance of chewing (mastication): increases surface area for chemical digestion (salivary amylase, lingual lipase); decreases abrasion of GI lining (especially pharynx and oesophagus). Chewing deficit does not compromise digestion but the process is greatly prolonged and large particles may hurt the gastric mucosa. Saliva is secreted during chewing to soften food and initiate enzymatic digestion.',

  'Saliva secretion volume: approximately 1.5 liters/day and it is the result of a cooperation between acinus and ductal cells in the salivary glands. Resting (basal) secretion: 0.5 l/day.',
  'Major salivary glands: Parotid Glands (2): secrete serous saliva, watery and rich in α-amylase (ptyalin), primarily responsible for digesting starches. Innervated by CN IX; inferior salivatory nucleus; otic ganglion. Submandibular Glands (2): produce a mixed secretion containing both serous fluid (rich in α-amylase) and mucous secretions (rich in mucin). Innervated by CN VII; superior salivatory nucleus; submandibular ganglion. Sublingual Glands (1): secrete primarily mucous saliva, thick and rich in mucin; provides lubrication and protection to the oral cavity. Innervated by CN VII; superior salivatory nucleus; submandibular ganglion.',
  'Composition of saliva: water (99%). Proteins and enzymes: α-Amylase (ptyalin) – secreted mainly by parotid and submandibular glands; lingual lipase – secreted by von Ebner\'s glands on the tongue; mucin – a glycoprotein that lubricates the food bolus. Organic components: enzymes (lipase, amylase), mucus, IgA, lysozyme, lactoferrin, EGF (epidermal growth factor). Ions: Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻, Ca²⁺, PO₄³⁻. Proteins: cystatins, histatins, proline-rich proteins. Antibodies: IgA.',
  'Electrolyte composition of saliva versus plasma: saliva contains higher concentrations of K⁺ (~30 mEq/L, seven times plasma) and HCO₃⁻ (50–70 mEq/L, 2–3 times plasma), while having lower Na⁺ (~15 mEq/L) and Cl⁻ (~15 mEq/L) concentrations than plasma. Saliva is hypotonic compared to plasma. At high secretion rates, there is less time for ductal modification, so saliva becomes less hypotonic and more similar to plasma in its electrolyte composition (composition varies with flow).',
  'Primary secretion by acinar cells: the acinar cells of the salivary glands produce an isotonic primary secretion that closely resembles plasma in its ionic composition. This fluid contains Na⁺, Cl⁻, K⁺, HCO₃⁻, and water, along with enzymes such as α-amylase (ptyalin) and mucin. The primary secretion flows from the acini into the salivary ducts, where it undergoes significant modification.',
  'Modification by ductal cells (secondary saliva): NaCl reabsorption > (K⁺ + HCO₃⁻) secretion; aldosterone controls this process. Na⁺ is actively reabsorbed by Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase pumps on the basolateral membrane of ductal cells (aldosterone-controlled). Cl⁻ passively follows Na⁺ reabsorption (via Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ pump). K⁺ is actively secreted into salivary fluid in exchange for Na⁺, increasing its concentration to ~30 mEq/L. HCO₃⁻ is secreted into the lumen via direct transport or in exchange for Cl⁻, maintaining alkaline pH. Tight junctions prevent water reabsorption → final saliva is hypotonic.',

  'Digestion: α-Amylase (Ptyalin): begins the digestion of carbohydrates by breaking down starch into maltose and dextrins. Lingual Lipase: initiates lipid digestion by hydrolyzing triglycerides, although its primary action occurs in the stomach.',
  'Buffering / alkaline pH: Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) acts as a buffer, maintaining an alkaline pH (fresh saliva) that neutralizes acid and prevents dental erosion. Alkaline pH preserves teeth; saliva is hypotonic.',
  'Protection of the oral mucosa: Mucins form a protective layer that coats the oral mucosa, preventing irritation and mechanical damage. Mucins also aid in food lubrication, making chewing and swallowing easier.',
  'Antimicrobial and bacteriostatic action: Lysozyme breaks down bacterial cell walls, inhibiting bacterial growth. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) prevents bacterial adhesion to oral surfaces, reducing the risk of infections. Lactoferrin and peroxidases also contribute to antimicrobial defense.',
  'Lubrication and solvent for taste: saliva lubricates food particles with mucins, and dissolves food substances so that taste buds can detect them properly. Maintains adequate moisture in the oral cavity for articulated speech.',
  'Excretion: saliva serves as a route of excretion for certain substances.',
  'Components of saliva important for oral hygiene: continuous salivary flow washes away food debris and bacteria, reducing plaque formation. Antimicrobial factors: Lysozyme (destroys bacterial cell walls), IgA (inhibits bacterial colonization and infection), cystatins, histatins. α-Amylase and Lipase reduce bacterial fermentation by breaking down food particles. Mucins form a protective barrier over the teeth and mucosa, preventing bacterial adhesion. Proline-rich proteins maintain mineralization of teeth (decreases incidence of dental caries). Bicarbonate and Calcium maintain remineralization of enamel, preventing tooth decay.',

  'Stimuli for salivary secretion: Chemoreceptors react to acidic stimuli (especially sour foods, which elicit the strongest salivary response, increasing secretion up to 8–20 times the basal rate). Mechanoreceptors react to chewing (mechanoreceptive reflexes). Other stimuli: seeing, smelling, thinking of food (conditioning / psychic effects). Nausea (via vagal reflex). Factors that decrease salivation: fear and anxiety (sympathetic dominance → dry mouth), dehydration, sleep (salivary secretion minimal), drugs (anticholinergics, antihistamines, sympathomimetics).',
  'Parasympathetic neural pathway (dominant): The superior and inferior salivatory nuclei in the brainstem (located at the junction of the medulla and pons) serve as the central control centers for salivation. These nuclei receive sensory inputs from taste and tactile receptors in the tongue, oral mucosa, and pharynx. Parasympathetic signals travel via: Facial nerve (CN VII) → chorda tympani → submandibular ganglion → submandibular and sublingual glands. Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) → otic ganglion → parotid gland. Postganglionic parasympathetic neurons release acetylcholine (ACh), which binds to muscarinic M3 receptors on acinar and ductal cells. Activation triggers IP₃ production → increased intracellular Ca²⁺ → copious fluid and enzyme secretion.',
  'Sympathetic neural pathway (secondary role): Preganglionic fibers originate from the thoracic spinal cord (T1–T3). They synapse in the superior cervical ganglion. Postganglionic sympathetic neurons travel along blood vessels to the salivary glands. These neurons release norepinephrine (NE), which binds to β-adrenergic and α-adrenergic receptors on the acinar and ductal cells.',
  'Vasodilation associated with parasympathetic stimulation: Parasympathetic nerve signals that induce copious salivation also moderately dilate the blood vessels. Part of this additional vasodilator effect is caused by kallikrein secreted by the activated salivary cells, which in turn acts as an enzyme to split one of the blood proteins, an α₂-globulin, to form bradykinin, a strong vasodilator.',
  'Difference in composition with parasympathetic vs. sympathetic stimulation: Parasympathetic stimulation: large volume, serous (watery), enzyme-rich saliva; high HCO₃⁻ → alkaline pH; vasodilation → sustained secretion. ACh → M3 receptor → IP₃, Ca²⁺ → fluid and enzyme secretion. Sympathetic stimulation: small volume, viscous, mucus-rich (protein-rich) saliva; lower HCO₃⁻; vasoconstriction → reduced blood flow and limiting secretion. NE → β-adrenergic receptor → adenylyl cyclase ↑ cAMP → increased protein/enzyme secretion. Composition of saliva varies with sympathetic/parasympathetic stimulation.',

  'Normal range of resting luminal esophageal pressures: Upper Esophageal Sphincter (UES): ~30–60 mmHg (high resting tone). Mid-Esophagus (intraluminal pressure): approximately −5 to −10 mmHg (slightly subatmospheric). Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES): ~10–30 mmHg (tonically contracted to prevent reflux).',
  'How esophageal pressure is measured in the clinic: Esophageal manometry is the gold standard for assessing intraluminal pressures. High-Resolution Manometry (HRM) is commonly used. A small pressure gauge is placed inside the esophagus and the pressure is measured (clinically, pressure above 40 mmHg in the LES region is indicative of achalasia). Pressure waves in the esophagus during swallowing (esophagometry) record: different mechanisms in upper vs. lower esophagus – still a smooth peristaltic wave! "Volume and pH clearance."',
  'Why luminal pressure varies with the respiratory cycle: The esophagus lies within the thoracic cavity, so its intraluminal pressure reflects intrapleural pressure changes. During inspiration: intrapleural pressure becomes more negative (~−7 to −10 mmHg); esophageal pressure decreases due to lung expansion and downward diaphragm movement. During expiration: intrapleural pressure becomes less negative (~−2 to −5 mmHg); esophageal pressure increases as the diaphragm relaxes. The diaphragm also mechanically reinforces the LES during inspiration, helping prevent gastric reflux. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., during straining or coughing) can elevate LES pressure to prevent reflux.',

  'Swallowing (deglutition): a vital BRAINSTEM reflex. A complex process that transfers food, liquid, or saliva from the oral cavity into the esophagus and ultimately to the stomach, while protecting the airway. Involves both voluntary and involuntary control and requires the coordination of over 25 muscles and multiple cranial nerves. Three phases: oral (voluntary), pharyngeal (reflex), esophageal (reflex).',
  'Afferents that initiate swallowing: Sensory (afferent) input is provided by several cranial nerves. The trigeminal nerve (CN V) detects tactile sensations from the oral cavity and teeth. The facial nerve (CN VII) carries taste information from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue. The glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) carries both touch and taste information from the posterior tongue and pharynx. The vagus nerve (CN X) carries sensory signals from the lower pharynx and larynx, particularly important for airway protection. Among these, CN IX and X play the most critical role in triggering the involuntary swallowing reflex. Mechanoreceptors in the oral mucosa, tongue, and palatoglossal arches detect the bolus.',
  'Major nuclei in the brainstem that integrate afferent inputs: These afferent signals are processed in the brainstem swallowing center, which consists primarily of two nuclei in the medulla oblongata. The nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) serves as the primary sensory relay center – it receives incoming sensory input and communicates with the nucleus ambiguus (NA), which generates the motor response to coordinate muscle activity. Other motor nuclei involved: trigeminal motor nucleus (jaw movement), facial motor nucleus (lip and cheek control), hypoglossal nucleus (tongue movement). Swallowing centers: medulla and pons.',
  'Motor (efferent) pathways and targets: Trigeminal nerve (CN V) controls the muscles of mastication and helps elevate the soft palate. Facial nerve (CN VII) controls the lips and cheeks, ensuring a tight oral seal. Glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX) activates the stylopharyngeus muscle, which helps elevate the pharynx. Vagus nerve (CN X) controls the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, the larynx, and the upper esophageal sphincter – plays a major role in both bolus propulsion and airway protection. Hypoglossal nerve (CN XII) moves the tongue, shaping and pushing the bolus effectively.',
  'Sequence of events during swallowing: Tongue pushes back the bolus into the pharynx (initiation). All passages that are otherwise open must be closed (airways): soft palate closes nasal cavity, larynx is elevated, glottis closes, breathing stops (deglutition apnea). Vocal cords adduct, closing off the airway. Epiglottis folds down to cover the glottis. UES relaxes, allowing the bolus to pass into the esophagus. Peristaltic contractions then carry the bolus toward the stomach; LES relaxes to permit entry.',

  'Upper esophagus – muscular and neural composition: The muscles of the pharynx and upper third of the esophagus are striated muscle. Peristaltic activity in the upper portion of the alimentary canal is controlled by somatomotor innervation. The peristaltic wave starts from the pharynx; here the peristalsis is caused by SEQUENTIAL FIRING of motor units.',
  'Lower esophagus – muscular and neural composition: The lower two-thirds of the esophagus consists of smooth muscle. The esophageal smooth muscles are controlled by parasympathetic activity of the vagus nerve: smooth muscle is actively RELAXED followed by rebound CONTRACTION. Controlled by the autonomic nervous system (ANS) and enteric nervous system (ENS) via the myenteric plexus.',
  'Upper Esophageal Sphincter (UES) – structure and tone mechanism: Located at pharynx-esophagus junction. Composed of striated (skeletal) muscle, primarily the cricopharyngeus muscle. Its tone is maintained by neurogenic somatomotor tone. Controlled by somatic motor neurons from the nucleus ambiguus of the brainstem, innervated by vagus nerve (CN X) and glossopharyngeal nerve (CN IX). The UES remains tonically contracted at rest to prevent air entry into the esophagus during breathing and protect against aspiration of gastric contents. UES relaxation during swallowing: the swallowing reflex inhibits neurogenic tone, causing relaxation; the UES opens, allowing food to pass into the esophagus; after swallowing, neurogenic control re-establishes contraction.',
  'Lower Esophageal Sphincter (LES) – structure and tone mechanism: Located at esophagus-stomach junction. Composed of smooth muscle; functions as a physiological sphincter rather than an anatomical one; not under voluntary control. Myogenic tone: the LES has an inherent basal myogenic tone modulated by the enteric nervous system. Also maintained by cholinergic (ACh) stimulation from excitatory vagal fibers originating from the dorsal motor nucleus. LES relaxation during swallowing: vagal inhibitory fibers release Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide (VIP) and Nitric Oxide (NO) → inhibit smooth muscle contraction → LES relaxes to allow food passage into the stomach. After the bolus passes, resting myogenic tone is restored, preventing gastric reflux.',
  'Peristaltic wave mechanism in the upper esophagus (striated muscle): The upper third of the esophagus consists of striated muscle under somatic control. Primary peristalsis is initiated by the swallowing reflex: swallowing center in the brainstem activates motor neurons → sequential activation of striated muscle fibers via the vagus nerve (CN X) → coordinated contraction wave moves the food bolus downward. Peristalsis in the upper esophagus is directly controlled by CNS motor neurons rather than intrinsic myogenic activity.',
  'Peristaltic wave mechanism in the lower esophagus (smooth muscle): Peristalsis is driven by sequential relaxation and contraction of smooth muscle via myenteric plexus control. Excitatory cholinergic neurons (Acetylcholine, Substance P) contract smooth muscle above the bolus (ascending stimulation: close lumen). Inhibitory neurons (VIP, NO) relax smooth muscle ahead of the bolus (descending inhibition: open lumen), allowing food to move forward. The bolus stretches the esophageal walls, activating stretch receptors that stimulate ascending (stimulatory) and descending (inhibiting) neurons. Different mechanisms in upper vs. lower esophagus – still a smooth peristaltic wave!',

  'Primary peristalsis: a continuation of the pharyngeal swallowing reflex. Initiated voluntarily when food is swallowed. Controlled by the swallowing center in the medulla via vagus nerve (CN X). A wave-like continuation of pharyngeal peristalsis moving from the pharynx to the stomach. Moves food from the pharynx to the stomach in 8–10 seconds. LES relaxes to allow food to enter the stomach.',
  'Secondary peristalsis: triggered by esophageal distension due to retained food (residual bolus left in the esophagus initiates new peristalsis). Occurs if primary peristalsis fails to clear the esophagus. Initiated by local reflex pathways – activation of stretch receptors in the esophageal wall. Above the stuck bolus: stimulates circular layer of muscles (contracts), inhibits longitudinal layer. Below the bolus: stimulates longitudinal layer of muscles, inhibits circular layers. Contract above bolus, relax below, to ensure bolus moves down. Continues until all food reaches the stomach.',
  'Dysphagia: difficulty or discomfort in swallowing. Causes include: inflammation, narrowing (stenosis), diverticulum (e.g., Zenker\'s diverticulum), motility troubles, rabies, reflux, medullary lesions.',
  'Achalasia: when the LES does not open. A disorder caused by loss of the distal part of the myenteric plexus → the LES fails to relax, leading to impaired peristalsis. The bolus accumulates proximally, starting to dilate the esophagus (megaesophagus). Diagnosed via esophageal manometry – pressure above 40 mmHg is indicative of achalasia. Symptoms: megaesophagus, dysphagia, regurgitation, coughing, weight loss, malnourishment. Treatment: surgical or conservative (botulinum toxin, nitrates, Ca²⁺ channel blockers).',
  'Aspiration: the inhalation of foreign material (e.g., food, vomitus, or mucus) into the respiratory tract, often occurring when a person is unconscious or under anesthesia. Prevented during normal swallowing by: elevation of soft palate (blocks nasal cavity), elevation of larynx and closure of vocal cords (seal off trachea), epiglottis folding down (mechanical shield), and brief inhibition of respiration (deglutition apnea) during the pharyngeal phase.',
