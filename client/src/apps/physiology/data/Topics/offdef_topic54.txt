officialDefinitions: [
  'Components of a nephron: 1/. A Malpighi body (glomerulus + Bowman-capsule). 2/. Proximal nephron: 2.1. convoluted tubule, 2.2. descending segment. 3/. Loop of Henle (thin descending segment, thin ascending segment, thick ascending segment). 4/. Distal nephron (distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct).',
  'Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): Location: The PCT is entirely situated in the renal cortex. Structure: This tubular segment is lined with cuboidal epithelial cells that possess an extensive brush border (microvilli) on their luminal surface to increase the surface area for reabsorption.',
  'Loop of Henle - Descending Thin Limb: Location: Begins in the renal cortex and descends into the renal medulla. Structure: Composed of squamous epithelial cells with high permeability to water and low permeability to solutes. Thin Ascending Limb: Location: Located entirely in the renal medulla. Structure: Thin squamous epithelium with impermeability to water but allows passive reabsorption of sodium and chloride. Thick Ascending Limb: Location: Starts in the medulla and re-enters the renal cortex. Structure: Lined with cuboidal epithelial cells containing many mitochondria for active transport.',
  'Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT): Location: Entirely located in the renal cortex. Structure: Lined by cuboidal epithelial cells with fewer microvilli compared to the PCT.',
  'Collecting Duct System: Cortical Collecting Duct: Location: Found in the renal cortex. Medullary Collecting Duct: Location: In the renal medulla. Papillary Ducts (of Bellini): Location: These ducts extend through the renal medulla and terminate at the renal papilla. Function: Deliver the final urine into the minor calyx, which then flows into the renal pelvis.',
  'Cortical and juxtamedullary nephrons: 1. The position of the glomerulus. 2. The length of the Henle-loop: long-looped nephrons (juxtamedullary), short-looped nephrons (cortical).',
  'Cortical Nephrons: Glomerular Location: Superficially located in the renal cortex. Loop of Henle: Short loop that barely dips into the medulla. Function: Bulk reabsorption of solutes and water. Juxtamedullary Nephrons: Glomerular Location: Close to the corticomedullary junction. Loop of Henle: Long loop that extends deep into the inner medulla. Function: Plays a key role in concentrating urine through the countercurrent multiplier system.'

// **LO-2** (Topic-54) - Major nephron segment contributions to reabsorption (CRITICAL)
officialDefinitions: [
  'Proximal Convoluted Tubule (PCT): Contribution: Reabsorbs 65-70% of the filtered load of sodium (Na⁺), water, and chloride (Cl⁻). It also reabsorbs almost all glucose, amino acids, and bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻). Transport Capacity: Sodium: Active reabsorption occurs via the Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase pump located on the basolateral membrane. Water: Water follows sodium osmotically through aquaporin-1 channels and tight junctions (solvent drag). Production of Concentration Gradients: Isosmotic reabsorption ensures that the tubular fluid remains at the same osmolarity as plasma (~300 mOsm/L).',
  'Descending Thin Limb: Contribution: Reabsorbs water but is impermeable to solutes. Transport Capacity: Water moves passively into the hyperosmotic medullary interstitium through aquaporin channels. Gradient Production: Concentrates tubular fluid (up to ~1200 mOsm/L at the hairpin turn).',
  'Thin Ascending Limb: Contribution: Passive reabsorption of sodium and chloride. Transport Capacity: Solutes diffuse into the interstitium; impermeable to water. Gradient Production: Begins diluting the tubular fluid.',
  'Thick Ascending Limb: Contribution: Reabsorbs 20-25% of filtered Na⁺, K⁺, and Cl⁻. Impermeable to water. Transport Capacity: Active reabsorption of solutes occurs via the Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ cotransporter. Gradient Production: Dilutes the tubular fluid (to ~100 mOsm/L at the end) and creates the medullary osmotic gradient essential for water reabsorption in the collecting duct. Known as the diluting segment.',
  'Distal Convoluted Tubule (DCT): Contribution: Reabsorbs 5-7% of filtered Na⁺ and Cl⁻, and fine-tunes calcium (Ca²⁺) reabsorption. Transport Capacity: Sodium and chloride are reabsorbed via the Na⁺/Cl⁻ cotransporter (NCC). Calcium reabsorption is regulated by parathyroid hormone (PTH). Gradient Production: Further dilutes the tubular fluid (to ~50-75 mOsm/L at the end).',
  'Cortical Collecting Duct: Contribution: Reabsorbs 3-5% of Na⁺ and variable amounts of water under hormonal control. Transport Capacity: Sodium reabsorption is mediated by epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) under the influence of aldosterone. Water reabsorption is regulated by antidiuretic hormone (ADH) through aquaporin-2 channels. Gradient Production: Determines the final urine osmolarity by balancing solute and water reabsorption.',
  'Medullary Collecting Duct: Contribution: Fine-tunes water reabsorption and urea recycling. Transport Capacity: ADH increases water permeability via aquaporin-2 channels, allowing water to be reabsorbed into the hyperosmotic medullary interstitium. Urea is reabsorbed via urea transporters, contributing to the medullary osmotic gradient. Gradient Production: Concentrates urine up to ~1200 mOsm/L in the presence of ADH.',
  'Summary of Filtered Load Reabsorption: Proximal Tubule: ~65-70% of Na⁺, Cl⁻, water, and other solutes. Loop of Henle: ~25% of Na⁺, Cl⁻; concentrates and dilutes tubular fluid. Distal Tubule: ~5-7% of Na⁺, Cl⁻; fine-tuning. Collecting Ducts: 3-5% of Na⁺, water reabsorption depends on ADH and aldosterone.',
  'Key Functional Gradients: The countercurrent multiplier system in the loop of Henle establishes a hyperosmotic medullary gradient. The countercurrent exchange system in the vasa recta maintains the gradient, allowing the nephron to concentrate or dilute urine as needed.'

// **LO-3** (Topic-54) - Renal epithelium structure and transport pathways (CRITICAL)
officialDefinitions: [
  'Transepithelial transport (Polarized cell): Epithelial cells are polarized. Apical membrane: faces the tubular lumen. Basolateral membrane: faces the interstitial fluid and blood. Tight junction: located at the interface between adjacent epithelial cells.',
  'Transepithelial transport: 2 membrane – 3 compartment model. Transepithelial transport can be found in kidney, gastrointestinal tract, exocrine glands, choroid plexus.',
  'Transcellular Pathway - Compound Example: Glucose. Mechanism: Apical Membrane: Glucose enters the epithelial cell from the tubular lumen via sodium-glucose cotransporters (SGLTs). The sodium gradient (low intracellular sodium and high extracellular sodium) drives this secondary active transport. Cytoplasm: Glucose accumulates within the epithelial cell after being transported in. Basolateral Membrane: Glucose exits the cell into the interstitial fluid by facilitated diffusion through glucose transporters (GLUTs). Energy Source: The sodium-glucose transport depends indirectly on ATP because the Na+/K+ ATPase pump on the basolateral membrane maintains the sodium gradient.',
  'Paracellular Pathway - Compound Example: Chloride ions (Cl⁻). Mechanism: Tight Junctions: Chloride ions move passively between epithelial cells through the tight junctions. Driving Force: The movement of sodium ions into the interstitial space creates a positive electrical potential, which drives the negatively charged chloride ions to follow along the paracellular route.',
  'How Water Movement is Driven by Solute Movement: Formation of an Osmotic Gradient: The active or passive movement of solutes (e.g., sodium, glucose, chloride) from the tubular lumen into the interstitial fluid increases the osmolarity of the interstitial space. This osmotic gradient draws water out of the tubular lumen into the interstitial fluid.',
  'Water Pathways - Transcellular Pathway: Water moves through aquaporins, which are specialized water channels located in the apical and basolateral membranes. Example: In the proximal tubule, aquaporin-1 (AQP1) channels facilitate rapid water reabsorption. Paracellular Pathway: Water moves between cells through leaky tight junctions, especially in areas like the proximal tubule.',
  'Water reabsorption (passive): transcellular, paracellular, "solvent drag" mechanism.',
  'The structure and composition of tight junctions vary in different nephron segments: Proximal tubule: "leaky" junctions → more paracellular transport. Collecting duct: "tight" junctions → limited paracellular flow.'

// **LO-4** (Topic-54) - Asymmetric distribution of transport proteins
officialDefinitions: [
  'Renal epithelial cells have polarized membranes, meaning that different transport proteins are located on the apical (luminal) and basolateral sides of the cell. This asymmetry is essential for directional (vectorial) transport of solutes and water across the epithelium.',
  'Directional (Vectorial) Transport: Apical membrane: faces the tubular lumen. Basolateral membrane: faces the interstitial fluid and blood. This polarity allows substances to: Enter the cell from one side (usually apical), Be processed or transported, Exit on the other side (basolateral) into the peritubular capillaries.',
  'Maintaining Directionality of Transport: The asymmetry ensures that solutes and water are transported in a unidirectional manner (from the tubular lumen → epithelial cells → interstitial fluid → peritubular capillaries). Example: Apical membrane: Sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) brings glucose and sodium from the tubular lumen into the cell. Basolateral membrane: Glucose exits into the interstitial fluid via GLUT transporters, and sodium is extruded by the Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase pump. Importance: Prevents the backflow of solutes into the tubular lumen and ensures net reabsorption.',
  'Establishment of Electrochemical Gradients: The Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase pump on the basolateral membrane creates a low intracellular sodium concentration and a high potassium concentration. This sodium gradient: Drives the secondary active transport of solutes such as glucose, amino acids, and phosphate across the apical membrane. Importance: Without this gradient, secondary active transport would not occur, and reabsorption of critical solutes would fail.',
  'Separation of Functions Between Membranes: Apical membrane: Specialized for solute uptake from the tubular lumen. Contains SGLTs, Na⁺/H⁺ exchangers, and other transporters for reabsorption. Basolateral membrane: Specialized for solute extrusion into the interstitial fluid. Contains GLUT transporters, Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase pumps, and Cl⁻ channels. Importance: Enables cells to perform reabsorption and secretion efficiently without interference between opposing transport processes.',
  'Regulation of Water Movement: The asymmetry of solute transport creates osmotic gradients that drive water reabsorption. Aquaporins: Present on both apical and basolateral membranes, ensuring water moves from the lumen to the interstitial space following solutes. Importance: Essential for maintaining water balance and preventing dehydration.',
  'Facilitates Hormonal Regulation: Hormones like aldosterone, antidiuretic hormone (ADH), and parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulate transport proteins on specific membranes. Apical membrane: Aldosterone increases the expression of ENaC (epithelial sodium channels) for sodium reabsorption. ADH increases aquaporin-2 expression to enhance water reabsorption. Basolateral membrane: ADH acts to enhance water transport via aquaporin-3 and -4. Importance: Allows for fine-tuned control of renal reabsorption and excretion to match the body\'s needs.'

// **LO-5** (Topic-54) - Tight junctions in leaky and tight epithelia
officialDefinitions: [
  'Tight junctions, located at the interface between adjacent epithelial cells, regulate the paracellular transport of solutes and water. Their functional properties differ between "leaky" and "tight" epithelia, which are adapted to distinct roles in the nephron.',
  'Tight Junctions in Leaky Epithelia: Permeability: Tight junctions in leaky epithelia are highly permeable, allowing significant paracellular transport of water and solutes. Function: Support bulk reabsorption of filtered solutes and water. Facilitate passive movement of small solutes like sodium (Na⁺), chloride (Cl⁻), and water.',
  'Examples of Leaky Epithelia in the Nephron: Proximal tubule: Accounts for reabsorption of ~65-70% of filtered sodium and water. Paracellular pathways complement transcellular transport mechanisms. Important for reclaiming glucose, amino acids, and bicarbonate. Descending limb of the loop of Henle: Specialized for passive water reabsorption, aiding in tubular fluid concentration. Solutes are not reabsorbed paracellularly in this segment.',
  'We assume that "leaky tight junctions" are in the proximal tubules. The entry of Na+ in the cell is a carrier-mediated process and is driven by an electrochemical gradient. Cl follows the movement of Na+ because of the electrochemical gradient and water enters because of the osmotic gradient.',
  'Highly Water Permeable Epithelia (e.g. proximal tubule): Iso-osmotic Absorption. Epithelia that transport large amounts of solute and water have long and highly enfolded lateral intercellular spaces. The apical surface area is usually enhanced by long and numerous microvilli called the brush border. It reduces the amount of fluid in one compartment and add fluid to another compartment without changing the ionic composition of either compartment.',
  'Tight Junctions in Tight Epithelia: Permeability: Tight junctions in tight epithelia are highly restrictive, minimizing paracellular transport and controlling selective movement. Function: Allow precise control over solute and water transport. Regulated by hormones, such as aldosterone (for Na⁺ reabsorption) and ADH (for water reabsorption).',
  'Examples of Tight Epithelia in the Nephron: Distal convoluted tubule: Tight junctions maintain low permeability to water and solutes. Facilitates fine-tuning of sodium and chloride reabsorption. Collecting duct: Tight junctions regulate water permeability based on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) action. Ensures efficient water conservation when needed.',
  'Water Impermeable Epithelia: These epithelia have low water permeability of their apical surfaces. They transport a solution that is strongly hypertonic. Hyper-osmotic Absorption: In these epithelia salts are absorbed but not water. The net effect is that salt is removed from the luminal compartment into the interstitial fluid without changing the amount of fluid in each compartment. Examples of this kind of epithelium are the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the distal nephron. In some epithelia water permeability is regulated.',
  'Water Movement Driven by Solutes: Leaky epithelia: High paracellular permeability allows water to follow solutes like sodium and chloride, maintaining osmotic gradients. Tight epithelia: Water movement occurs transcellularly through aquaporins, regulated by hormones (e.g., ADH in the collecting duct).'
