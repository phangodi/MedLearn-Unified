        'Hepatic portal system - anatomy and role: blood flow in the splanchnic circulatory bed flows through portal circulation. Nutrients and hormones from the GI tract act on the liver in highest concentration. Venous blood from the GI organs drains into the portal circulation, which ensures that absorbed nutrients reach the liver first. Major veins involved: intestinal veins (from the small and large intestines); splenic vein (drains the spleen and pancreas); portal vein (collects blood from the GI tract, spleen, and pancreas → transports it to the liver); hepatic sinusoids (capillary networks in the liver that filter blood); hepatic vein (carries filtered blood from the liver to the inferior vena cava).',
        'Hepatic portal system - functions: filtration and detoxification of blood (Kupffer cells): blood from the gut is rich in nutrients but also contains potential pathogens, toxins, and waste products. Kupffer cells, specialized macrophages lining liver sinusoids, remove bacteria, toxins, and other harmful agents to prevent systemic infection. Nutrient processing and storage: water-soluble nutrients (carbohydrates, amino acids, vitamins, minerals) are absorbed by the intestines and transported via the portal vein to the liver sinusoids. Hepatic parenchymal cells (hepatocytes) absorb and temporarily store these nutrients, ensuring stable blood glucose and amino acid levels. Glucose storage (glycogen synthesis) and release during fasting. Amino acid metabolism and protein synthesis (albumin, clotting factors). Vitamin and mineral storage (A, D, B12, iron, copper). Hormone and drug metabolism: the liver metabolizes hormones and drugs, modifying their activity or preparing them for excretion. Detoxifies ammonia (urea cycle) to prevent neurotoxicity. Lipid transport (bypassing portal circulation): unlike carbohydrates and proteins, dietary fats are absorbed into the lymphatic system (lacteals) and bypass the liver initially, entering circulation via the thoracic duct.',
        'Hepatic artery - role in flow and oxygen: while the liver receives 75-80% of its blood supply from the hepatic portal vein, this blood is nutrient-rich but oxygen-poor. The hepatic artery provides oxygenated blood, ensuring the liver\'s high metabolic demands are met. The hepatic artery branches from the celiac trunk and supplies oxygenated blood to the liver tissue. It accounts for ~20-25% of total liver blood flow but provides 50% of the liver\'s oxygen supply due to the lower oxygen content of portal venous blood. The hepatic artery branches into interlobular arterioles, which supply the connective tissue and hepatocytes in the lobules and merge with portal venous blood in liver sinusoids, forming a dual blood supply system.',
        'Liver microcirculation - overview: arterial and portal blood is mixed in the sinusoids; there is no barrier between the plasma and the liver interstitium (Disse spaces). Proteins move freely; lymph production is large. Under pathological conditions fluid can move through the liver capsule into the abdominal cavity: Ascites.',
        'Hepatic microcirculation - circulatory flow pathway: interlobar arteries and veins → interlobular arteries and veins → perilobular arteries and veins → sinusoids. Blood percolates through sinusoids, interacting directly with hepatocytes. Blood drains into central veins → sublobular veins → hepatic veins → inferior vena cava (IVC).',
        'Sinusoid capillaries - morphological features: hepatic sinusoids are specialized capillaries with distinct structural adaptations to maximize blood-hepatocyte interactions. Discontinuous endothelium (no basement membrane): highly fenestrated (pores ~100-150 nm in diameter), allows direct exchange of macromolecules (proteins, lipids, nutrients, hormones, and toxins) between blood plasma and hepatocytes. Sinusoid is lined with endothelial cells. The sinusoid is permeable to lipoproteins but impermeable to chylomicrons.',
        'Sinusoid capillaries - cellular components: Kupffer cells (resident macrophages in sinusoids): line the sinusoidal lumen, functioning as immune regulators; trap and remove bacteria, endotoxins, and aged red blood cells (RBCs). Space of Disse (perisinusoidal space): located between endothelial cells and hepatocytes; allows plasma to flow freely, facilitating nutrient uptake and secretion of plasma proteins (e.g., albumin, clotting factors); contains hepatic stellate cells (Ito cells), which store vitamin A and regulate extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Hepatocytes (liver parenchymal cells): arranged in plates, lining the sinusoids for direct blood contact; perform metabolic functions including glucose storage, lipid metabolism, detoxification, and bile production.',
        'Sinusoid capillaries - functional features: nutrient exchange and metabolism: sinusoidal fenestrations allow free diffusion of nutrients into hepatocytes. Glucose, amino acids, and lipids are absorbed and metabolized for storage or energy production. Hepatocytes synthesize plasma proteins (albumin, clotting factors) and release them back into circulation. Sinusoids have low vascular resistance, ensuring efficient hepatic perfusion. Hepatic stellate cells regulate sinusoidal diameter, responding to vasoactive substances.',
        'Ascites - development from increased venous pressure: ascites is the accumulation of excess fluid in the peritoneal cavity, primarily caused by portal hypertension due to increased venous pressure in the splanchnic circulation. In diseases like liver cirrhosis, the liver becomes fibrotic → resistance to blood flow increases → raises pressure in the portal vein and hepatic sinusoids → hydrostatic pressure in capillaries of the abdominal organs (especially intestines) increases. According to Starling\'s law: net filtration = (capillary hydrostatic pressure - interstitial hydrostatic pressure) - (capillary oncotic pressure - interstitial oncotic pressure). Increased hydrostatic pressure pushes fluid out of capillaries. If albumin levels are low (common in liver disease), plasma oncotic pressure is reduced → less reabsorption of fluid. Excess interstitial fluid begins to leak across the serosal surfaces into the peritoneal cavity (usually a transudate in pure portal hypertension).',
        'Ascites - lymphatic overload and RAAS activation: the liver normally produces lymph, which drains into the thoracic duct. In portal hypertension, lymph production increases dramatically (since proteins move freely in Disse spaces). The lymphatic system becomes overwhelmed, and lymph leaks directly into the peritoneal cavity, worsening ascites. Secondary sodium and water retention (RAAS activation): with fluid accumulating in the abdomen, effective circulating volume is perceived as low. This activates RAAS (renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system), ADH (vasopressin), and the sympathetic nervous system → sodium and water retention by the kidneys → further expansion of plasma volume → more filtration into the peritoneal cavity → worsening ascites.'
