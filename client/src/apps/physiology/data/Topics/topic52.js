Kf equals hydraulic conductivity multiplied by surface area. GFR is determined by the equation: GFR equals Kf multiplied by net filtration pressure. Two factors determine Kf. First, the surface area of glomerular capillaries, modulated by mesangial cell contraction or relaxation. Mesangial contraction reduces surface area, decreasing Kf and lowering GFR, while relaxation increases surface area, increasing Kf and raising GFR. Second, the permeability of the filtration barrier depends on the integrity of capillary endothelium, basement membrane, and podocyte slit diaphragms. Increased permeability raises Kf but may cause proteinuria. Decreased permeability lowers Kf and reduces GFR. Therefore, Kf directly determines GFR for any given net filtration pressure.'
