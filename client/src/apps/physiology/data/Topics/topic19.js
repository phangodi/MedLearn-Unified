          'Ganglion Cell (Postganglionic Neuron): The ganglion cell, or postganglionic neuron, has receptors on its membrane that bind to the neurotransmitter released by the preganglionic neuron. These receptors are nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (N2 subtype), which are ionotropic receptors.',

Receptor Type: The neurotransmitter ACh binds to nicotinic cholinergic receptors (N2) on the postganglionic neuron. These receptors are ligand-gated ion channels that, upon activation, allow the influx of sodium (Na^+) ions and the efflux of potassium (K^+) ions, leading to depolarization of the ganglion cell membrane.',
          'When acetylcholine binds to the nicotinic receptors, it causes a rapid depolarization of the postganglionic neuron, resulting in the generation of an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). If the EPSP is strong enough, it will trigger an action potential in the postganglionic neuron, which will then propagate along its axon to the target effector organ.',
          'The transmission at the ganglionic synapse can be modulated by various substances, including neuropeptides, nitric oxide (NO), and other modulatory neurotransmitters, which can either enhance or inhibit the synaptic activity. Additionally, postsynaptic potentials at these synapses can be influenced by both fast and slow synaptic mechanisms: Fast EPSPs: Mediated by the direct activation of nicotinic receptors. Slow EPSPs: Involves the activation of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs), which modulate the response by changing the excitability of the postganglionic neuron over a longer period.',
          'The autonomic ganglionic synapse is more complex compared to the neuromuscular junction due to the presence of various receptor types (e.g., nicotinic and muscarinic receptors) and the modulation by other neurotransmitters and neuropeptides.
