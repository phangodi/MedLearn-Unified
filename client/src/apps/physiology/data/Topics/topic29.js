        'Physically Dissolved CO₂ (5-10%): CO₂, being a gas, can dissolve in the blood plasma. The amount of dissolved CO₂ is directly proportional to its partial pressure in the blood and is influenced by its solubility coefficient. The solubility of CO₂ in blood is much higher than that of oxygen, allowing a small but physiologically significant amount to be transported this way. CO₂ dissolves directly into the plasma, contributing to the total CO₂ content. This portion represents about 5-10% of the total CO₂ transported in the blood. Although minimal compared to the other forms, it plays a critical role in maintaining the CO₂ partial pressure gradient between the tissues and the blood, which drives diffusion.',
        'Chemically Dissolved as Bicarbonate Anions (60-70%): The majority of CO₂ in the blood is transported in the form of bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻), which form through a series of chemical reactions that involve carbonic anhydrase. Formation of Carbonic Acid: Inside red blood cells (RBCs), CO₂ reacts with water (H₂O) to form carbonic acid (H₂CO₃). This reaction is catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, which greatly speeds up the process. Dissociation to Bicarbonate and Hydrogen Ions: Carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) quickly dissociates into bicarbonate ions (HCO₃⁻) and hydrogen ions (H⁺). Chloride Shift (Hamburger Shift): To maintain electrical neutrality within the RBC, bicarbonate ions are transported out of the cell into the plasma in exchange for chloride ions (Cl⁻). This exchange is known as the chloride shift and the transporter known as band 3. The exchange process helps maintain a balance of charges and osmotic balance within the RBCs and plasma. Reversibility: This reaction is reversible. In the lungs, the process is reversed as bicarbonate ions re-enter RBCs, combine with hydrogen ions to form carbonic acid, which then dissociates into CO₂ and H₂O. The CO₂ is then expelled during exhalation. Contribution: Bicarbonate anions account for about 60-70% of the CO₂ transported in the blood, making this the most significant CO₂ transport method.',
        'Hemoglobin-Bound CO₂ (Carbaminohemoglobin) (20-30%): CO₂ can bind directly to hemoglobin, but unlike oxygen, it binds to the amino groups of the globin protein rather than the heme group. CO₂ binds with the terminal amino groups of hemoglobin (forming carbaminohemoglobin or Hb-CO₂). This binding occurs more readily when hemoglobin is in its deoxygenated form. Therefore, deoxygenated blood in the tissues promotes the formation of carbaminohemoglobin.',
        'Alternative percentages from Respiration_2.pdf: Bicarbonate (chemically dissolved) ~85%, Carbamino groups (Hb-bound) ~10%, Dissolved as gas ~5%.',
        'Fast Processes - Formation of Carbaminohemoglobin: The binding of CO₂ to hemoglobin (forming carbaminohemoglobin) is relatively rapid. This process occurs without the need for an enzyme and happens quickly as hemoglobin releases oxygen in the tissues and binds CO₂. Physically Dissolved CO₂: The simple dissolution of CO₂ in plasma is immediate and occurs at the same rate as CO₂ diffuses from tissues into the blood.',
        'Slow Processes - Formation of Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻): In the absence of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase, the conversion of CO₂ and H₂O into carbonic acid (H₂CO₃) is relatively slow. This reaction becomes fast inside RBCs due to the presence of carbonic anhydrase, but when it happens in plasma (without the enzyme), it remains slow.',
        'CO₂ distribution from tissues to alveoli: 2-10% dissolved in the blood plasma. 20% bound to the amino acids of the globin chains forming carbamino hemoglobin. 70% hidden in the form of bicarbonate.',
        'CO₂ Solubility: Unlike oxygen, CO₂ has a higher solubility in plasma, which allows it to be transported effectively. CO₂ is 20 times more soluble than oxygen in the blood plasma and alveolar fluid, hence it moves more easily.'
