        'Enteral nervous system (ENS) general characteristics: The gastrointestinal tract has a nervous system all its own called the enteric nervous system. It lies entirely in the wall of the gut, beginning in the esophagus and extending all the way to the anus. The number of neurons in this enteric system is greater than 100 million, more than the number in the entire spinal cord. In humans 4-600 MILLION neurons, similar to that of spinal cord! ("visceral brain" aka "brain in the gut"). This highly developed enteric nervous system is especially important in controlling gastrointestinal movements and secretion.',
        'ENS development: The enteral neurons stem from the parasympathetic (mainly vagal) portions of the neural crest; the sacral origin neuronal population is important in the hindgut.',
        'ENS plexuses - anatomical position: The enteric nervous system is composed mainly of two plexuses: (1) an outer plexus lying between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers, called the myenteric plexus or Auerbach\'s plexus; and (2) an inner plexus, called the submucosal plexus or Meissner\'s plexus, which lies in the submucosa. (Myentericus pl is present from esophagus; submucosal from the stomach on.)',
        'Myenteric plexus (Auerbach\'s plexus) - function: The myenteric plexus controls mainly the gastrointestinal movements. The myenteric plexus consists mostly of a linear chain of many interconnecting neurons that extends the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract. Because it lies between the longitudinal and circular layers of intestinal smooth muscle, it is concerned mainly with controlling muscle activity along the length of the gut. When stimulated, its principal effects are: (1) increased tonic contraction, or "tone," of the gut wall; (2) increased intensity of the rhythmic contractions; (3) slightly increased rate of the rhythm of contraction; and (4) increased velocity of conduction of excitatory waves along the gut wall. The myenteric plexus should not be considered entirely excitatory because some of its neurons are inhibitory; their fiber endings secrete an inhibitory transmitter, possibly vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or some other inhibitory peptide. Inhibitory signals are especially useful for inhibiting some intestinal sphincter muscles (pyloric sphincter, sphincter of the ileocecal valve).',
        'Submucosal plexus (Meissner\'s plexus) - function: The submucosal plexus controls mainly gastrointestinal secretion and local blood flow. It is mainly concerned with controlling function in the inner wall of each minute segment of the intestine. Many sensory signals originate from the gastrointestinal epithelium and are integrated in the submucosal plexus to help control local intestinal secretion, local absorption, and local contraction of the submucosal muscle that causes various degrees of infolding of the gastrointestinal mucosa.',
        'Major ENS neuron types (cellular divisions of enteric ganglia): 1. Intrinsic sensory neurons (IPANs): sensitive to mechanical and/or chemical stimuli from the mucosa; also stretch-sensitive receptors in the muscle layers. 2. Interneurons: excitatory or inhibitory. 3. Excitatory or inhibitory effector neurons controlling the smooth muscle and glands. Complicated reflex pathways.',
        'Afferent sensory nerve fibers from the gut: Many afferent sensory nerve fibers innervate the gut. Some have their cell bodies in the enteric nervous system, and some have them in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord. These sensory nerves can be stimulated by (1) irritation of the gut mucosa, (2) excessive gut distention, or (3) the presence of specific chemical substances in the gut. Signals transmitted through the fibers can cause excitation or inhibition of intestinal movements or intestinal secretion. Note: 80% of the nerve fibers in the vagus nerves are afferent rather than efferent.'

Sacral division (pelvic splanchnic nerves): supplies the distal colon, rectum, and anus.

Short-loop reflexes exit the gut wall and are processed in prevertebral sympathetic ganglia - the celiac or mesenteric ganglia - returning efferent inhibitory signals via norepinephrine; the ileogastric reflex, where ileal distension inhibits gastric motility, is a key example. Long-loop reflexes involve the central nervous system: afferent signals travel via vagal, pelvic, or splanchnic nerves to the brainstem or spinal cord, with efferent responses returning via parasympathetic pathways releasing acetylcholine, VIP, and gastrin-releasing peptide, or sympathetic pathways releasing norepinephrine. The vagovagal reflex - stomach distension triggering receptive relaxation via VIP and NO through the nucleus tractus solitarius - and the defecation reflex involving the spinal cord and pelvic nerves are key long-loop examples.'

        'Overview of enteroendocrine system: The enteroendocrine cells producing peptide signalling molecules are found singly in the mucosal epithelium. Secretion is controlled by luminal chemical signals, ENS neurons, other enteroendocrine cells, even immune cells. The released molecules can control in a paracrine/endocrine manner directly GIS smooth muscle and glands, but may have also indirect effects through effects on ENS neurons or other enteroendocrine cells. GIS hormones can affect also the CNS (e.g., food intake), and can modulate insulin secretion in the pancreas (incretin effects).',
