  'Electric dipole: a pair of equal and opposite electric charges or magnetic poles of equal magnitude separated by a small distance. The dipole has both a magnitude (charge) and a direction (from the negative to the positive charge). It generates an electric field and is described by a dipole vector pointing from the negative charge to the positive charge.',
  'Vector characteristics: Magnitude: The size or length of the vector, which indicates the strength of the quantity. Direction: The orientation in space that shows the way the vector is pointing. Point of Application: The specific location where the vector acts. Line of Action: The line along which the vector acts, which indicates its influence in a particular direction.',
  'Dipoles and ECG waveforms: As the wave of depolarization or repolarization moves, the net dipole also moves (called the mean electrical vector). ECG electrodes detect the projection of this moving dipole vector onto the lead axis: If the wave of depolarization moves toward a positive electrode → upward (positive) deflection. If it moves away from the positive electrode → downward (negative) deflection. If it moves perpendicular to the lead → minimal or biphasic deflection.'

  'Standardized electrode placement: Clinicians use a standardized approach for electrode placement and polarities to ensure consistency in ECG recordings. The 12-lead ECG system provides a comprehensive view of the heart\'s electrical activity from different perspectives. This system is divided into limb leads and precordial (chest) leads, which together create a 3-dimensional understanding of cardiac function.',

  'P Wave: The P wave is the first upward deflection in an ECG tracing. Represents atrial depolarization, where the electrical impulse spreads from the sinoatrial (SA) node across the atria, leading to atrial contraction. Duration: Typically less than 100 ms.',
  'PR Interval: The PR interval is the time from the beginning of the P wave to the start of the QRS complex. Represents the time it takes for the electrical impulse to travel from the atria through the atrioventricular (AV) node and into the ventricles. Duration: Normally between 0.12 and 0.20 seconds.',
  'PQ Segment (PR Segment): No net electrical movement OR activity is directed perpendicular to the axis of Lead II → Flat line, Isoelectric line. The AV node takes it time with the electrical activity, slows down conduction (1 second delay) and holds the activity within it. Delay before sends down the action potentials to Bundle of His, bundle branches, to the ventricles.',
  'QRS Complex: The QRS complex represents the rapid depolarization of the ventricles. Depolarization spreads from the AV node to the bundle of His, bundle branches, and Purkinje fibers, causing ventricular contraction. Duration: Typically 0.06 to 0.10 seconds, 80 ms.',
  'QRS Complex components: Q Wave: The initial downward deflection. R Wave: The first upward deflection. S Wave: The subsequent downward deflection.',
  'ST Segment: The flat, isoelectric segment between the end of the S wave and the beginning of the T wave. Represents the period when the ventricles are depolarized and are in the initial phase of repolarization. When the entire ventricular myocardium is completely depolarized, all of the charges are positive → no movement, just waiting for it to be repolarized.',
  'T Wave: The T wave is the upward deflection following the QRS complex. Represents ventricular repolarization, where the ventricles return to their resting electrical state.',
  'QT Interval: The time from the beginning of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave. Represents the total time for ventricular depolarization and repolarization. Duration: Varies with heart rate; typically, 320-390ms for a normal heart rate.',

  'Mean electrical vector (axis): The mean electrical vector (axis) of the heart represents the average direction of electrical depolarization as it travels through the heart\'s ventricles during the cardiac cycle. This vector is crucial for understanding the electrical orientation of the heart and how it aligns within the thorax. It is depicted as an arrow pointing in the general direction of the depolarization, with its length proportional to the magnitude of the electrical activity.',
  'Normal Range of Mean Electrical Axis: The typical mean electrical axis in a healthy adult ranges from 30° to +60°. This orientation reflects the usual leftward and downward direction of electrical conduction through the ventricles. In the frontal plane, normal: -30° - 90°. Left deviated: < -30°. Right deviated: > 90°.',
  'Determining Mean Electrical Axis from QRS: The mean electrical axis can be determined by analyzing the QRS complex in the standard limb leads (I, II, and III) on an ECG. Determine the net deflection of the QRS complex in each limb lead by measuring the difference between the height of the positive and negative deflections. Identify the lead with the most positive net deflection, which indicates the direction in which the majority of electrical depolarization is occurring.',
  'Quadrant method for axis determination: If Lead I is positive and Lead aVF is positive, the axis is within the normal range (0° to +90°). If Lead I is positive and Lead aVF is negative, the axis may indicate left axis deviation (e.g., -30° to -90°). If Lead I is negative and Lead aVF is positive, this may indicate right axis deviation (e.g., +90° to +180°). If both Lead I and Lead aVF are negative, this could indicate an extreme axis deviation (e.g., -90° to -180°).',
  'Precise calculation: Exact calculation can be done using the hexaxial reference system, by plotting the net QRS deflections from two limb leads to find the precise mean electrical axis.',
  'Clinical significance: Left Axis Deviation: May suggest left ventricular hypertrophy or conduction blocks. Right Axis Deviation: May indicate right ventricular hypertrophy or pulmonary conditions.'
