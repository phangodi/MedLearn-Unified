// **LO-1** (Topic-66) Describe the cellular mechanisms for the hepatic uptake, conjugation, and secretion of bile salts and bilirubin
officialDefinitions: [
  'Bile salt uptake (basolateral membrane): Bile salts, primarily reabsorbed from the intestine via enterohepatic circulation, are taken up into hepatocytes through basolateral membrane transporters. The main transporter is the sodium-dependent NTCP (Na⁺-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide), which handles conjugated bile salts, while OATPs (organic anion transporting polypeptides) assist in the sodium-independent uptake of unconjugated bile acids.',
  'Bilirubin uptake: Bilirubin, derived from the breakdown of heme (from hemoglobin), circulates in the blood bound to albumin. Hepatocytes take up this albumin-bound, unconjugated bilirubin using OATP transporters.',
  'Bile acid conjugation (inside hepatocyte): Bile acids are conjugated with either glycine or taurine to increase their water solubility and detergent effectiveness. Conjugation with Glycine: Chenodeoxycholic acid → Glycochenodeoxycholic acid; Cholic acid → Glycocholic acid. Conjugation with Taurine: Chenodeoxycholic acid → Taurochenodeoxycholic acid; Cholic acid → Taurocholic acid. The substances produced are conjugated bile salts.',
  'Bilirubin conjugation (inside hepatocyte): Bilirubin, which is hydrophobic in its unconjugated form, undergoes conjugation with glucuronic acid via the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1), forming the water-soluble conjugated bilirubin (bilirubin diglucuronide).',
  'Apical secretion into bile canaliculi: Both substances are actively secreted into the bile canaliculi on the apical side of hepatocytes. Conjugated bile salts are transported via the ATP-dependent BSEP (Bile Salt Export Pump), whereas conjugated bilirubin is secreted through MRP2 (Multidrug Resistance-associated Protein 2), another ATP-dependent transporter.',
  'Bilirubin origin: Bilirubin is the breakdown product of the heme in hemoglobin. The breakdown of old and defective red blood cells occurs in different organs with sinusoidal capillaries — Spleen (main), Liver, Red bone marrow. Heme gets broken down to Fe⁺⁺ and biliverdin by heme oxygenase. Biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin by bilirubin reductase. Bilirubin is lipid soluble and binds to albumin for transport to the liver.',
  'Conjugated bilirubin excretion: The conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the biliary system through multi resistance associated peptide type 2 (MRP2). Disruption in any of these steps — whether due to genetic mutations (e.g., UGT1A1 deficiency, BSEP defects) or liver dysfunction — can lead to clinical conditions such as jaundice or cholestasis.',

// **LO-2** (Topic-66) List the water, ionic, bile salt, phospholipids, cholesterol, bicarbonate, xenobiotics and bilirubin components of bile as secreted by the liver and after modification by the gallbladder
officialDefinitions: [
  'Bile from the liver: golden yellow; pH is close to neutral.',
  'Water: 97–98% of bile (liver bile: 97.5 g/dl).',
  'Ionic components (liver bile): Sodium (Na⁺) 145 mEq/L; Potassium (K⁺) 5 mEq/L; Calcium (Ca²⁺) 5 mEq/L; Chloride (Cl⁻) 100 mEq/L; Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) 28 mEq/L — alkaline component to neutralize acid from the stomach.',
  'Bile salts: Synthesized from cholesterol in the liver. Primary bile acids: Cholic acid (via 7-α-hydroxylase CYP7E1 and 12-α-hydroxylase CYP8B1) and Chenodeoxycholic acid (via 7-α-hydroxylase CYP7E1 only). Conjugated with glycine or taurine to form bile salts (e.g., Glycocholic acid, Taurocholic acid), which are more water-soluble. Liver bile: 1.1 g/dl bile salts.',
  'Phospholipids: 30–40% of organic components; mainly Lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) — amphipathic and aids in micelle formation. Liver bile: 0.04 g/dl; Gallbladder bile: 0.3 g/dl.',
  'Cholesterol: Excreted by the liver into bile. Liver bile: 0.1 g/dl; Gallbladder bile: 0.3–0.9 g/dl.',
  'Bilirubin: 0.3% — a breakdown product of hemoglobin. Conjugated in the liver to bilirubin glucuronide (bilirubin diglucuronide) for excretion. Liver bile: 0.04 g/dl; Gallbladder bile: 0.3 g/dl.',
  'Fatty acids: Liver bile: 0.12 g/dl; Gallbladder bile: 0.3–1.2 g/dl.',
  'Xenobiotics (drugs, toxins, hormones): Various waste products metabolized by the liver are excreted into bile.',
  'Modification of bile in the gallbladder: Bile from the gallbladder is dark green; components are in higher concentration; pH slightly acidic. The gallbladder absorbs up to 90% of water, concentrating bile salts, phospholipids, and cholesterol. Sodium (Na⁺) 130 mEq/L and Chloride (Cl⁻) 25 mEq/L in gallbladder bile (reduced from liver values as Na⁺ and Cl⁻ are absorbed). Gallbladder bile salts: 6 g/dl (up from 1.1 g/dl in liver bile).',
  'pH adjustments in gallbladder: The bile in the gallbladder becomes more acidic (pH ~5–6) due to proton secretion. The stored bile is acidified to prevent the precipitation of bile salts and cholesterol. The increase in bile salt concentration enhances its detergent properties, improving the digestion and absorption of lipids when bile is released into the duodenum.',

// **LO-3** (Topic-66) CRITICAL — Explain the mechanisms stimulating gall bladder contraction and the secretion of bile through the sphincter of Oddi into the small intestine
officialDefinitions: [
  'Overview: When food begins to be digested in the upper gastrointestinal tract, the gallbladder begins to empty, especially when fatty foods reach the duodenum about 30 minutes after a meal. The mechanism of gallbladder emptying is rhythmic contractions of the gallbladder wall, but effective emptying also requires simultaneous relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi, which guards the exit of the common bile duct into the duodenum. The mechanisms involve hormonal and neural controls, mainly mediated by cholecystokinin (CCK) and the autonomic nervous system.',
  'Cholekinetic factors (stimulate gallbladder contraction and sphincter relaxation simultaneously): CCK; Vagus; (gastrin).',
  'CCK (Cholecystokinin) — major stimulus: CCK is released by I cells of the duodenum in response to the presence of fatty acids, amino acids, and small peptides in the duodenum. CCK stimulates gallbladder contraction directly and induces relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi, which allows bile to flow into the duodenum. CCK acts through CCK-A receptors on smooth muscle cells of the gallbladder and neurons of the enteric nervous system. Mechanism: CCK binds to receptor on the gallbladder → gallbladder contracts → squeezes out concentrated bile → CCK binds to receptor on the sphincter of Oddi → stimulates the sphincter and relaxes it → bile is released into the duodenum.',
  'Neural control of gallbladder contraction: Vagus nerve stimulation (parasympathetic) also contributes to gallbladder contraction via acetylcholine (ACh). ACh acts on muscarinic receptors (M3) of gallbladder smooth muscle, enhancing contractions. The enteric nervous system modulates bile secretion in response to local stimuli.',
  'Sphincter of Oddi relaxation: Sphincter of Oddi relaxation is mediated by NO (nitric oxide). CCK induces relaxation of the sphincter of Oddi indirectly via vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and nitric oxide (NO), which inhibit sphincter contractions. Neural mechanisms (vagal efferents and enteric reflexes) also contribute to sphincter relaxation.',
  'Rhythmic ejection of bile: Bile is released in pulsatile spurts, synchronized with duodenal contractions. When duodenal pressure is low, bile is ejected. When duodenal pressure is high (during contractions), bile ejection is temporarily reduced.',
  'Choleretic factors (stimulate bile secretion/production by liver): Recirculated bile acids (reabsorbed bile acids are the strongest stimulus for bile secretion); Secretin; CCK?',
],

// **LO-4** (Topic-66) Describe the amphipathic structure of bile salts, and describe how this property assists the solubilization and digestion of fats
officialDefinitions: [
  'Amphipathic structure of bile salts: Bile salts are amphipathic molecules — they possess both hydrophobic (lipid-soluble) and hydrophilic (water-soluble) sides. The hydrophobic side associates with lipids, while the polar side chains (hydrophilic side) associate with water.',
  'Bile salts vs. bile acids: Bile acids are the unconjugated forms. Bile salts are the conjugated forms (with glycine or taurine), which are ionized and more water-soluble at intestinal pH.',
  'Emulsification: Bile salts (derived from cholesterol in the liver) and lecithin (a phospholipid) act as detergents that surround large lipid droplets and break them into smaller droplets (bile salt coat). This process increases the total surface area, allowing better enzyme access. Emulsification does not involve enzymatic digestion, but it prepares lipids for enzyme action.',
  'Micelle formation: The end products of lipid digestion (monoglycerides, FFAs, cholesterol, lysolecithin) are incorporated into micelles formed by bile salts, allowing them to remain soluble. Micelles are small disks with bile salts, phospholipids, fatty acids, cholesterol, and mono- and diglycerides. Core: hydrophobic lipid digestion products. Outer layer: amphipathic bile salts (hydrophobic tails inward, hydrophilic heads outward). Micelles act as shuttles, transporting lipids to the brush-border membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. Micelle formation is required for absorption — short and medium chain (C<14) FAs do not form micelles — free diffusion!!!',
  'Unstirred water layer: Micelles of bile salts and products of lipid digestion diffuse through the unstirred layer to reach the enterocytes. At the acidic pH of the unstirred water layer near the brush border, FA anions combine with H⁺ and diffuse into the enterocytes.',
  'Colipase interaction: Bile salts coat the lipid droplets, preventing pancreatic lipase from binding directly. Colipase (activated from procolipase by trypsin) displaces bile salts, allowing pancreatic lipase to bind to the lipid-water interface and digest triglycerides. Bile salts and lecithin thus enhance colipase binding.',
  'Cholelithiasis: Micelles of bile salts + cholesterol + phospholipids — imbalance in this mixture can lead to cholelithiasis (gallstones).',
],

// **LO-5** (Topic-66) CRITICAL — Explain the mechanism of reabsorption of bile acids/salts in the small intestine (ileum)
officialDefinitions: [
  'Overview: About 95% of bile salts are actively reabsorbed in the terminal ileum. A small portion is passively absorbed in the colon or excreted in feces (especially lithocholic acid, which is more toxic and poorly reabsorbed).',
  'Active reabsorption in ileum — ASBT: Bile acids are actively reabsorbed in the terminal ileum by ASBT (apical sodium-dependent bile acid transporter). This is Na⁺-coupled cotransport (shown on the diagram as Na⁺ co-transporting with bile acids at the ileal apical membrane).',
  'Passive reabsorption: Some unconjugated bile acids (more hydrophobic) can be passively absorbed throughout the small intestine and colon by simple diffusion across the lipid bilayer.',
  'Return to liver via portal blood: Reabsorbed bile salts travel via the portal vein back to the liver, where they are taken up by NTCP (sodium-dependent) and OATP transporters and re-secreted into bile.',
  'Reabsorbed bile acids are the strongest stimulus for bile secretion: Both primary and secondary bile acids are reabsorbed; the liver secretes both forms.',
  'Fecal excretion and de novo synthesis: The ~5% of bile salts lost in feces is replenished by de novo synthesis in the liver from cholesterol. The rate-limiting step is 7-α-hydroxylase (CYP7E1). High levels of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid allosterically regulate (inhibit) that enzyme — feedback inhibition.',
],

// **LO-6** (Topic-66) Describe the enterohepatic circulation, including any different handling among primary and secondary bile salts and bile acids
officialDefinitions: [
  'Enterohepatic circulation overview: Enterohepatic circulation is the recycling system of bile salts and bile acids between the liver, intestine, and blood. It plays a crucial role in conserving bile components and regulating lipid digestion. Bile acids are produced in the liver, secreted in the biliary system, transported to the intestine, metabolized by bacteria located there to secondary bile salts, and the secondary bile acids are transported back to the liver via the portal circulation.',
  'Step 1 — Liver synthesis and secretion: The liver synthesizes primary bile acids (cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid) from cholesterol. These are then conjugated with glycine or taurine, forming bile salts (e.g., taurocholate), which are secreted into bile via the bile salt export pump (BSEP) into bile canaliculi, stored in the gallbladder, and released into the duodenum during meals.',
  'Step 2 — Intestinal transformation to secondary bile acids: In the intestine, gut bacteria deconjugate and dehydroxylate primary bile salts using 7-α-dehydroxylase to form secondary bile acids: Cholic acid → Deoxycholic acid; Chenodeoxycholic acid → Lithocholic acid. Secondary bile acids are less water-soluble but still reabsorbed and reused. Secondary bile acids can also conjugate with glycine and taurine.',
  'Step 3 — Reabsorption: About 95% of bile salts are actively reabsorbed in the terminal ileum by ASBT. A small portion is passively absorbed in the colon or excreted in feces.',
  'Step 4 — Return to liver: Reabsorbed bile salts travel via the portal vein back to the liver, where they are taken up by NTCP (sodium-dependent) and OATP transporters and re-secreted into bile.',
  'Rate-limiting step: The hydroxylation by 7-α-hydroxylase (CYP7E1) is the rate-limiting step — slowest and one of the most important steps. High levels of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid allosterically regulate (inhibit) that enzyme.',
  'Different handling — primary vs. secondary: Primary bile salts are synthesized de novo and efficiently reabsorbed. Secondary bile acids (formed by bacterial action) are more hydrophobic and less efficiently reabsorbed, with lithocholic acid being largely excreted to prevent toxicity. Primary and secondary bile acids are both reabsorbed; the liver secretes both forms.',

// **LO-7** (Topic-66) Describe the secretory function of the hepatobiliary epithelium and how bile participates in the control of duodenal pH. How is HCO₃⁻ secretion controlled in the hepatobiliary system (secretin)?
officialDefinitions: [
  'Reference value: Bile secretion: 600 ml/day.',
  'Hepatocyte secretion (primary bile — bile-acid dependent flow): Hepatocytes actively secrete bile salts, cholesterol, phospholipids, and bilirubin conjugates. This primary bile is isotonic and flows into bile canaliculi. Reabsorbed bile acids are the strongest stimulus for bile secretion.',
  'Duct cell secretion (modified bile — bile-acid independent flow): Cholangiocytes (epithelial cells of bile ducts) modify bile by secreting HCO₃⁻ (bicarbonate) and water. This makes bile more alkaline, important for neutralizing gastric acid in the duodenum. Bile from the liver: golden yellow; pH is close to neutral.',
  'Mechanism of bile secretion (hepatocyte): Na⁺, K⁺, Cl⁻, H₂O are exchanged at the hepatocyte. Bile acids are transported from blood into hepatocyte via Na⁺ co-transport (NTCP) and via K⁺/HCO₃⁻ exchange. Bile acids are then exported apically into the canaliculus via BSEP.',
  'Mechanism of HCO₃⁻ secretion by duct cells: In the duct cell, HCO₃⁻ is secreted into the bile duct lumen. Na⁺ and Cl⁻ are reabsorbed in the gallbladder. The gallbladder absorbs Na⁺, Cl⁻, HCO₃⁻, and H₂O, concentrating the bile.',
  'Control of HCO₃⁻ secretion — Secretin: Choleretic factors include recirculated bile acids and secretin. Secretin is released by S cells in the duodenum in response to low pH (acidic chyme). It binds to receptors on cholangiocytes and: stimulates bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) and water secretion into bile; increases cAMP, which activates CFTR Cl⁻ channels → Cl⁻ is secreted into bile ducts; Cl⁻ is then exchanged for HCO₃⁻ via a Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger → this alkalinizes bile. Secretin also stimulates bile release (liver secretes bile containing bicarbonate).',
  'Additional regulation of HCO₃⁻ secretion: Vagal stimulation (ACh): enhances bile flow and ductular secretion. Bile acids themselves stimulate cholangiocytes via TGR5 receptors, promoting bicarbonate-rich secretion (bile-acid dependent flow). CCK binding to the receptor on the liver accentuates the action of secretin, increasing bile synthesis.',
  'Role of bile in duodenal pH control: When bile enters the duodenum, it emulsifies fats to aid digestion and neutralizes acidic gastric chyme (along with pancreatic bicarbonate), maintaining duodenal pH around 6.5–7.5 — optimal for enzyme activity and mucosal protection. Bile release is stimulated by secretin, similar to pancreatic secretion.',
