        raw: 'Cardiac catheterization is an invasive procedure where a thin catheter is inserted into a blood vessel and guided to the heart to evaluate and treat cardiac conditions. Usually performed through femoral artery in the groin or radial artery in the wrist with patient sedated under local anesthesia. Fluoroscopy provides real-time X-ray guidance. Purposes include measuring pressures within heart chambers and blood vessels, evaluating heart valve function and myocardial performance, identifying coronary artery blockages, and collecting blood samples for oxygen measurement. Coronary angiography involves injecting contrast dye to visualize coronary arteries and chambers. Right heart catheterization measures right heart and pulmonary artery pressures. Interventional procedures such as angioplasty or stent placement can be performed to open blocked arteries.'
