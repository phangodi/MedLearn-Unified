  'Invasive Method - Catheter + Pressure Transducer: A catheter is inserted into an artery (commonly the radial or femoral artery). The catheter is connected to a fluid-filled tubing system linked to an external pressure transducer. The transducer converts the mechanical pressure from blood flow into an electrical signal, which is displayed as a waveform on a monitor.',
  'Invasive Method - Direct Measurement: Provides real-time, continuous monitoring of blood pressure. Highly precise, as it measures the actual pressure inside the artery. Displays systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, and allows for detailed analysis of pulse pressure and waveform morphology.',
  'Invasive Method - Applications: Critical care settings (e.g., during surgery or in ICU). Monitoring in unstable patients requiring moment-to-moment blood pressure changes.',
  'Invasive Method - Advantages: Accurate, continuous, and reliable. Allows sampling of arterial blood gases.',
  'Invasive Method - Disadvantages: Invasive, with risks of infection, bleeding, or arterial damage. Requires trained personnel and specialized equipment.',
  'Non-Invasive Method - Sphygmomanometry: A cuff is placed around the upper arm (or sometimes another limb). The cuff is inflated above systolic pressure, temporarily occluding blood flow in the brachial artery. As the cuff deflates, blood flow resumes, and Korotkoff sounds are detected using a stethoscope or a digital sensor.',
  'Non-Invasive Method - Systolic Pressure: The pressure at which the first Korotkoff sound is heard as blood flow begins to return.',
  'Non-Invasive Method - Diastolic Pressure: The pressure at which the Korotkoff sounds disappear as blood flow normalizes.',
  'Non-Invasive Method - Types: Auscultatory Method uses a stethoscope to detect Korotkoff sounds (manual). Oscillometric Method measures pressure oscillations in the cuff (digital).',
  'Non-Invasive Method - Advantages: Non-invasive, simple, and widely available. No significant risk to the patient.',
  'Non-Invasive Method - Disadvantages: Less accurate compared to invasive methods, especially in patients with arrhythmias or very low pressures. Requires proper technique for reliable readings.'

  'Systolic Pressure (SBP): the highest arterial pressure measured during a cardiac cycle. The maximum pressure exerted in the arteries when the left ventricle contracts and ejects blood into the aorta during systole.',
  'Systolic Pressure - Physiological Basis: The heart generates high pressure to overcome vascular resistance and propel blood through the systemic circulation. Systolic pressure is influenced by cardiac output, arterial compliance, and peripheral resistance.',
  'Systolic Pressure - Reference Value: 120 mmHg (Normal range: 90–140 mmHg).',
  'Diastolic Pressure (DBP): the lowest arterial pressure measured during a cardiac cycle. The minimum pressure in the arteries when the heart relaxes and fills with blood during diastole.',
  'Diastolic Pressure - Physiological Basis: Diastolic pressure is maintained by the elastic recoil of large arteries (e.g., aorta) and peripheral resistance. Ensures continuous blood flow to tissues during diastole.',
  'Diastolic Pressure - Reference Value: 80 mmHg (Normal range: 60–90 mmHg).',
  'Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): the average pressure in a complete cardiac cycle. The average arterial pressure during a single cardiac cycle, representing the effective pressure that drives blood to the tissues. MAP is closer to diastolic pressure because the heart spends more time in diastole than systole.',
  'Mean Arterial Pressure - Formula: MAP = DBP + 1/3 PP. This formula accounts for the longer duration of diastole compared to systole.',
  'Mean Arterial Pressure - Reference Value: 93 mmHg (Normal range: 70–100 mmHg).',
  'Pulse Pressure (PP): SBP - DBP. The difference between systolic and diastolic pressures, reflecting the force generated by the heart with each beat and the compliance of the arteries.',
  'Pulse Pressure - Reference Value: 40 mmHg (Normal range: 30–50 mmHg).',
  'Pulse Pressure - Physiological Basis: A normal pulse pressure ensures adequate perfusion while preventing excessive stress on arterial walls. Determined by stroke volume and arterial compliance.',
  'Blood Pressure Curve Components: Anacrotic limb (upstroke), Systolic peak (maximum pressure), Dicrotic notch (or incisura), Dicrotic limb (downstroke), End diastole.',
  'Dicrotic Notch: produced when the aortic valve closes, it produces a brief period of retrograde flow from the aorta back toward the valve, briefly decreasing the aortic pressure below the systolic value.'

  'Windkessel Effect: explains how the aorta and large elastic arteries convert the pulsatile blood flow generated by the heart into a smoother, continuous flow. This mechanism is essential for maintaining steady perfusion to tissues and reducing the workload on the heart.',
  'Windkessel Effect - Systole (Heart Contraction): The left ventricle ejects blood into the aorta with high pressure. The aorta, being an elastic artery, stretches to accommodate this blood volume. The elastic wall stores some of the ejected blood\'s energy as elastic potential energy. This stretching prevents excessive increases in systolic pressure and reduces the immediate resistance against the heart.',
  'Windkessel Effect - Diastole (Heart Relaxation): When the heart relaxes, the aortic valve closes to prevent backflow into the ventricle. The aortic wall recoils due to its elasticity, releasing the stored energy. This recoil propels the blood forward into the systemic circulation, ensuring blood flow even when the heart is not actively pumping.',
  'Windkessel Effect - Energy Storage and Release: During systole, the aorta absorbs energy by stretching. During diastole, it releases this energy by recoiling.',
  'Windkessel Effect - Smoothing of Blood Flow: The pulsatile nature of cardiac output is dampened, producing a more continuous blood flow in smaller arteries and capillaries.',
  'Windkessel Effect - Pressure Regulation: The Windkessel effect prevents extreme fluctuations in blood pressure, protecting delicate microcirculatory systems.'

  'Stroke Volume (SV) - Increased SV: Systolic Pressure increases (More blood ejected into aorta leads to greater pressure rise). Diastolic Pressure remains unchanged or slightly increases (May increase due to higher end-diastolic volume but minimally). Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) increases (MAP = CO × TPR; increased CO via SV raises MAP). Pulse Pressure (PP) increases (PP = SBP – DBP; SBP rises more than DBP).',
  'Stroke Volume (SV) - Decreased SV: Opposite effects: decreased SBP, decreased PP, decreased MAP, DBP unchanged or slight decrease.',
  'Arterial Compliance - Decreased Compliance (e.g. aging, arteriosclerosis): Systolic Pressure increases (Stiffer arteries can\'t absorb pressure rise). Diastolic Pressure decreases (Less elastic recoil during diastole). MAP: Slight increase or unchanged. Pulse Pressure increases significantly (Widened; classic in elderly).',
  'Arterial Compliance - Increased Compliance (more elastic arteries): Systolic Pressure decreases. Diastolic Pressure increases. Pulse Pressure decreases. MAP unchanged (may stay normal if CO and TPR are constant).',
  'Total Peripheral Resistance (TPR) - Increased TPR (vasoconstriction): Systolic Pressure increases. Diastolic Pressure increases significantly (Less runoff from arteries during diastole). MAP increases. Pulse Pressure decreases (More effect on DBP than SBP).',
  'Total Peripheral Resistance (TPR) - Decreased TPR (vasodilation): Systolic Pressure decreases or unchanged. Diastolic Pressure decreases. MAP decreases. Pulse Pressure increases (SBP relatively preserved, DBP falls).'

  'Pressure Pulse Propagation: The pressure pulse is a wave of pressure generated by ventricular systole, not the movement of blood itself. It propagates along the arterial walls at a speed called the pulse wave velocity (PWV).',
  'Pulse Wave Velocity: Faster in stiffer arteries (e.g., in peripheral arteries or with aging) and slower in more compliant arteries (e.g., the aorta). In the aorta: 3-5 m/s. In the little arteries: 15-30 m/s.',
  'Changes in Pressure Waveform - Increase in Pulse Pressure: Systolic Pressure (SP) increases in peripheral arteries due to Wave Reflection (Pulses reflected from peripheral sites (e.g., arterioles) add to the forward wave, amplifying systolic pressure) and Reduced Compliance (Peripheral arteries are stiffer, so they expand less for a given volume of blood, increasing systolic pressure). Diastolic Pressure (DP) remains similar or slightly lower, leading to Widened Pulse Pressure (PP) in peripheral arteries compared to the aorta.',
  'Changes in Pressure Waveform - Distortion of the Waveform: The pressure waveform becomes sharper and more peaked in the peripheral arteries due to increased wave reflection and faster transmission of the pulse wave. In the aorta, the waveform is smoother and more rounded because of the compliance of the aortic wall.',
  'Changes in Pressure Waveform - Delay in Timing: The systolic peak occurs slightly later in peripheral arteries compared to the aorta due to the travel time of the pulse wave.',
  'Changes in Pressure Waveform - Toward the periphery: Systolic peak increases. Dicrotic notch disappears. Diastolic peak appears. Time lag.',
  'Changes in Pressure Waveform - Causes of the alterations: Damping. Interference with reflected waves. Pressure-dependent propagation.',
  'Mean Flow Velocity: approximately 20-30 cm/s in the aorta. Decreases toward the periphery.',
  'Contrast Pressure Pulse with Flow Pulse: The propagation velocity of pressure pulse is much faster than the velocity of blood flow. Pressure pulse increases toward the periphery. Flow pulse decreases toward the periphery.'

  'Arterial Pulse: The pressure changes in the aorta during the cardiac cycle are transmitted along the arteries as a pressure pulse. Creating a volume pulse that can be palpated by pressing the arteries against a flat hard surface. The pulse depends on the function of BOTH the heart and the transmitting arteries.',
  'Pulse Quality - Frequency: tachycardia (frequens) or bradycardia (rarus). The number of pulses felt per minute. Normal: 60–100 beats per minute (bpm) in adults.',
  'Pulse Quality - Rhythmicity: regular (regularis) or irregular (irregularis). The regularity of the pulse, reflecting the heart\'s rhythmic contractions.',
  'Pulse Quality - Pulse wave amplitude (arterial wall deflection): high (altus) or low (parvus). The strength or force of the pulse, determined by the stroke volume and vascular tone.',
  'Pulse Quality - Steepness of pulse wave (arterial wall deflection speed): rapid rise (celer) or slow rise (tardus). The speed at which the pulse rises and falls.',
  'Pulse Quality - Pulse suppression: hard (difficult to suppress - durus) or soft (easy to suppress - mollis).',
  'Pulse Quality - Pulsus equalis: when fullness, height, speed and hardness of the pulse waves are equal.',
  'Pulse Quality - Absolute arrhythmia (pulsus irregularis et inaequalis/irregular and unequal pulse): the time intervals between beats are different and the fullness of the pulses are different.',
  'Pulse Quality - Symmetry: Comparing the pulse on both sides of the body to ensure equal strength and rhythm.',
  'Clinical Example - In hypovolemia (shock): parvus, frequent and mollis.'
