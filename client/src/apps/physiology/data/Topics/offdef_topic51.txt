  'Systemic neural control (extrinsic mechanisms): Sympathetic nervous system exerts tonic vasoconstrictor tone via norepinephrine → α₁-adrenergic receptors → vasoconstriction. Purpose: maintains vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure. Limits unnecessary skeletal muscle blood flow at rest.',
  'Modulation of systemic neural control: Sympathetic activity increases during stress or standing (orthostasis) to maintain perfusion pressure. β₂-adrenergic receptors (activated by epinephrine) can cause mild vasodilation, but effect is limited at rest.',
  'Local control mechanisms (intrinsic mechanisms): Crucial during exercise when skeletal muscle blood flow needs to increase dramatically to meet metabolic demands.',
  'Metabolic vasodilation: Active skeletal muscles release metabolites (e.g., adenosine, K⁺, H⁺, lactate, CO₂) that cause vasodilation of precapillary arterioles. These metabolites override sympathetic vasoconstriction (a phenomenon called functional sympatholysis).',
  'Functional sympatholysis: Local metabolites blunt vasoconstrictor effects of sympathetic activity. Allows regional blood flow to match local metabolic need despite systemic vasoconstriction.',
  'Myogenic response: Arteriolar smooth muscle responds to changes in intraluminal pressure. Increased pressure → Vasoconstriction. Decreased pressure → Vasodilation.',
  'Flow-mediated vasodilation: Increased blood flow induces shear stress on the vascular endothelium, leading to the release of nitric oxide (NO), which causes vasodilation.',
  'Reactive hyperemia: Following a period of ischemia, blood flow increases significantly to repay the oxygen debt and remove accumulated metabolites.',
  'Active hyperemia: During exercise, blood flow increases proportionally to metabolic activity due to the combined effects of metabolite release and shear stress.',
  'Relative importance at rest: Systemic neural control (sympathetic vasoconstriction) dominates to maintain basal vascular tone and ensure blood flow to vital organs. Neural control limits skeletal muscle perfusion to approximately 20-25% of cardiac output.',
  'Relative importance during exercise: Local control becomes predominant, overriding sympathetic vasoconstriction in active muscles. Functional sympatholysis ensures adequate blood flow to exercising muscles despite global sympathetic activation. Local control increases skeletal muscle perfusion, which can rise to 80-90% of cardiac output in intense exercise.',
  'Sympathetic vasoconstrictor effect: most powerful in the kidneys, gut, spleen, and skin, less potent in skeletal muscle and the brain. Not all vessels have significant sympathetic vasoconstrictor tone. Cerebral and coronary vessels are the most important exemptions.',
  'Sympathetic vasoconstrictor innervation of vascular smooth muscle: ATP (P2X1 ionotropic receptor), noradrenaline (α-1 metabotropic receptor) and NPY cotransmission.'

  'Peripheral resistance during exercise: Total Peripheral Resistance (TPR) decreases due to widespread vasodilation in active skeletal muscles. Local metabolites (e.g., adenosine, CO₂, H⁺, and K⁺) and flow-mediated vasodilation reduce vascular resistance in exercising muscles. Vasodilation in active muscles overrides the systemic sympathetic vasoconstriction, a phenomenon called functional sympatholysis. Vasoconstriction in non-essential tissues (e.g., gastrointestinal organs, kidneys) helps maintain systemic vascular resistance.',
  'Cardiac output at rest: Normal cardiac output is approximately 5-6 L/min.',
  'Cardiac output during exercise: Cardiac output increases dramatically, depending on exercise intensity, up to 20-25 L/min in untrained individuals and 35-40 L/min in highly trained athletes.',
  'Mechanisms of cardiac output increase: Heart Rate (HR): Linear increase with exercise intensity, driven by parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic activation. Maximal HR = ~220 − age (approximate). Stroke Volume (SV): Increases due to enhanced venous return (via muscle pump, respiratory pump, and venoconstriction) and increased myocardial contractility (via sympathetic stimulation). Plateaus at moderate exercise intensity in untrained individuals but continues to rise in elite athletes.',
  'A-V oxygen difference: The difference in oxygen content between arterial and venous blood. Indicates the amount of oxygen extracted by tissues.',
  'A-V oxygen difference at rest: ~5 mL O₂/dL blood.',
  'A-V oxygen difference during exercise: Increases significantly (up to 15-17 mL O₂/dL blood) due to enhanced oxygen extraction by working muscles. Contributing factors: Increased capillary recruitment. Increased mitochondrial activity and oxygen consumption. Enhanced unloading of oxygen from haemoglobin due to: Decreased pH (Bohr effect). Increased local CO₂ and temperature in active muscles.',
  'Arterial pressure during exercise - systolic pressure: Increases proportionally with exercise intensity due to increased cardiac output. Can reach 180-200 mmHg during intense exercise.',
  'Arterial pressure during exercise - diastolic pressure: Remains unchanged or slightly decreases due to reduced peripheral resistance.',
  'Arterial pressure during exercise - mean arterial pressure: Slightly increases, but the increase is less pronounced than systolic pressure due to vasodilation in skeletal muscles.',
  'Skeletal muscle blood flow at rest: Skeletal muscles receive 20-25% of cardiac output (~1-1.5 L/min), reflecting low metabolic demand.',
  'Skeletal muscle blood flow during exercise: Skeletal muscles receive up to 80-90% of cardiac output (~20-30 L/min) during maximal exercise, driven by: Metabolic vasodilation. Functional sympatholysis. Redistribution of blood flow: Reduced blood flow to non-essential organs (e.g., splanchnic circulation). Maintained flow to vital organs (e.g., brain, heart).'

  'Skeletal muscle vascular beds during sustained exercise: Skeletal muscle receives 80-90% of cardiac output during sustained exercise, compared to ~20% at rest. Blood flow to active muscles increases dramatically due to: Local Metabolic Vasodilation: Mediators: adenosine, K⁺, CO₂, lactate, H⁺. Reduced oxygen levels (hypoxia) trigger vasodilation. Functional Sympatholysis: Local metabolites counteract sympathetic vasoconstriction, ensuring adequate perfusion of working muscles. Increased Cardiac Output: Heart pumps more blood to meet the increased oxygen demand of skeletal muscles. Skeletal muscle blood flow may reach 20-30 L/min during intense exercise.',
  'Cerebral circulation (CNS) during sustained exercise: Maintained or Slightly Increased Blood Flow. The brain receives a constant percentage of cardiac output (~750 mL/min or 15% at rest). Absolute blood flow may increase slightly (~13-15% of cardiac output) to maintain oxygen delivery despite higher metabolic demand. Mechanisms: Autoregulation ensures constant cerebral perfusion across a wide range of blood pressures. Increased arterial CO₂ levels (hypercapnia) during exercise enhance cerebral vasodilation.',
  'Coronary circulation during sustained exercise: Increased Blood Flow. Coronary blood flow increases proportionally to the increased oxygen demand of the heart (myocardial oxygen consumption). Mechanisms: Local Metabolic Vasodilation: Adenosine is a key vasodilator released during increased cardiac activity. Sympathetic stimulation increases heart rate and contractility, necessitating increased coronary perfusion. Coronary blood flow can increase 3-4 times during exercise, ensuring adequate oxygen delivery to meet myocardial demand.',
  'Splanchnic circulation during sustained exercise: Decreased Blood Flow. Blood flow to the gastrointestinal organs and liver is reduced during exercise, falling from ~25% of cardiac output at rest to ~3-5% during sustained exercise. Mechanisms: Sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction of splanchnic arteries reduces perfusion. Redistribution of blood to active muscles takes precedence over digestive functions. Consequences: Reduced gastrointestinal motility and absorption. Temporary ischemia in prolonged exercise may cause gastrointestinal discomfort.',
  'Cutaneous circulation during sustained exercise: Dynamic Blood Flow Changes. Initially, cutaneous blood flow decreases due to sympathetic vasoconstriction. As exercise continues, cutaneous blood flow increases for thermoregulation: Heat produced by working muscles is dissipated through the skin. Sweat production requires increased blood flow to the skin to transfer heat to the environment. Balance: Blood flow to the skin is tightly regulated to balance thermoregulation with maintaining perfusion of vital organs and muscles.'

  'Extravascular compression - phasic contraction: Phasic (intermittent) muscle contractions, such as those occurring during rhythmic activities like walking or running, cause pulsatile extravascular compression of veins and small arteries. Blood vessels are compressed during contraction, forcing blood out of the veins toward the heart. During relaxation, veins refill from upstream. Effect: Promotes effective venous return without prolonged occlusion of blood flow.',
  'Extravascular compression - sustained contraction: Sustained (isometric) muscle contractions, such as holding a heavy object or static exercise, lead to prolonged extravascular compression of blood vessels. This compresses veins and small arteries continuously, reducing blood flow to the muscle tissue and causing a transient reduction in venous return. Effect: Can impede perfusion and oxygen delivery to tissues if maintained for an extended period, potentially leading to ischemia.',
  'Central venous pressure - phasic contraction: Phasic contractions enhance venous return to the heart via the muscle pump mechanism, increasing central venous pressure transiently during contraction and relaxation phases. This increases the preload on the heart, facilitating a higher stroke volume and cardiac output.',
  'Central venous pressure - sustained contraction: Sustained contractions increase extravascular compression of veins, impeding venous return and causing a reduction in central venous pressure over time as blood flow becomes restricted. This can lead to reduced preload and cardiac output if sustained for prolonged periods.',
  'Muscle pump definition and importance: The muscle pump is the rhythmic contraction of skeletal muscles that aids in the propulsion of venous blood toward the heart. It is critical for maintaining circulation, particularly during physical activity.',
  'Muscle pump - promotes venous return: During phasic contractions, blood is actively "pumped" through the venous system back to the heart, counteracting the effects of gravity in upright positions. Prevents blood pooling in the lower extremities and maintains cardiac preload.',
  'Muscle pump - prevents venous stasis: Prevents prolonged stasis of blood in veins, reducing the risk of conditions like deep vein thrombosis (DVT).',
  'Muscle pump - enhances cardiac output: Increased venous return via the muscle pump raises central venous pressure and preload, which increases stroke volume and cardiac output through the Frank-Starling mechanism.',
  'Muscle pump - maintains perfusion during exercise: In rhythmic exercise, the muscle pump ensures that venous blood is effectively returned, maintaining perfusion pressure and nutrient delivery to the muscles.'

  'Valsalva maneuver definition: A forced expiration against a closed glottis, commonly used in clinical and physiological studies to assess the cardiovascular system. The maneuver leads to significant changes in cardiac output (CO) and arterial pressure (AP) due to alterations in intrathoracic pressure, venous return, and autonomic nervous system activation. These changes occur in four distinct phases, each with specific effects and compensatory mechanisms.',
  'Phase I - Initial Increase in Intrathoracic Pressure - Mechanism: Forced expiration increases intrathoracic pressure (~40 mmHg or more). This compresses the thoracic aorta and other intrathoracic vessels.',
  'Phase I - Effects on arterial pressure: The compression of the aorta and large arteries causes a transient rise in arterial pressure due to increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR). This rise is short-lived because it is mechanical and not due to increased cardiac output.',
  'Phase I - Effects on cardiac output: Unchanged initially, as venous return and preload are not yet significantly reduced.',
  'Phase I - Compensatory responses: Baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch detect the transient rise in blood pressure. They trigger a reflex vagal activation, causing a transient decrease in heart rate (bradycardia).',
  'Phase II - Reduced Venous Return and Cardiac Output - Mechanism: Sustained high intrathoracic pressure compresses the intrathoracic veins. This reduces venous return (preload) to the heart. The reduced preload leads to a drop in stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) via the Frank-Starling mechanism.',
  'Phase II - Effects on arterial pressure: As cardiac output declines, arterial pressure falls despite compensatory increases in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). The fall in pressure depends on the degree of venous return reduction.',
  'Phase II - Effects on cardiac output: Declines progressively due to reduced venous return and preload.',
  'Phase II - Compensatory responses - Baroreceptor reflex: Decreased arterial pressure is detected by baroreceptors in the carotid sinus and aortic arch. This triggers: Increased sympathetic outflow: Vasoconstriction of peripheral vessels → increased SVR. Increased heart rate (tachycardia) and contractility (positive inotropy). Reduced parasympathetic activity: This facilitates the tachycardia. These mechanisms aim to restore blood pressure and maintain perfusion, especially to vital organs like the brain.',
  'Phase III - Release of Intrathoracic Pressure - Mechanism: At the end of forced expiration, the glottis opens, and intrathoracic pressure normalizes rapidly. Thoracic aorta and veins are no longer compressed.',
  'Phase III - Effects on arterial pressure: Transiently drops as the external compression on the aorta is released. Venous blood flow into the thoracic cavity is not yet fully restored, contributing to the temporary decrease in pressure.',
  'Phase III - Effects on cardiac output: Begins to recover as venous return improves.',
  'Phase III - Compensatory responses: Baroreceptors briefly signal for sympathetic activation to prevent excessive pressure drops. Reflex tachycardia may occur transiently during this phase.',
  'Phase IV - Recovery Phase - Mechanism: Venous return is fully restored, increasing preload and stroke volume. Cardiac output increases as the heart responds to improved preload (via the Frank-Starling mechanism).',
  'Phase IV - Effects on arterial pressure: Rises above baseline temporarily due to: Increased stroke volume. Persistent vasoconstriction from Phase II's sympathetic activation. The pressure overshoot is corrected by parasympathetic activation.',
  'Phase IV - Effects on cardiac output: Peaks as venous return normalizes and compensatory mechanisms enhance cardiac function.',
  'Phase IV - Compensatory responses - Baroreceptor reflex: High arterial pressure is detected. This activates vagal (parasympathetic) stimulation and reduces sympathetic outflow. Heart rate slows, and vascular resistance decreases, restoring arterial pressure to baseline levels.'
