  'Nasal turbinates (or conchae): curved bony structures inside the nasal cavity, covered with a vascular mucous membrane. Air Filtration: The mucosa traps dust, allergens, and pathogens using mucus and cilia. Air Humidification: Moistens inspired air to protect the lower airways. Air Warming: The rich blood supply warms the air to near body temperature. Airflow Regulation: Their curved shape creates turbulence, improving contact between inhaled air and the mucosa for better conditioning.',
  'Sneezing Reflex: Purpose: Clears the upper airways (mainly the nasal cavity) of irritants. Trigger: Irritation of nasal mucosa (e.g., dust, pollen). Pathway: Sensory receptors in the nasal mucosa detect the irritant. Signal travels via the trigeminal nerve (CN V) to the sneeze center in the medulla. A coordinated response involves deep inhalation, glottis closure, pressure buildup, and sudden forceful expulsion of air through the nose and mouth. Effect: High-velocity airflow (~100 mph) expels irritants.',
  'Coughing Reflex: Purpose: Clears the lower airways (larynx, trachea, bronchi) of mucus, foreign particles, or irritants. Trigger: Irritation of respiratory epithelium (e.g., smoke, secretions). Pathway: Sensory receptors (mostly in the larynx and trachea) send signals via the vagus nerve (CN X) to the cough center in the medulla. A deep breath is followed by closure of the glottis and contraction of expiratory muscles. Sudden opening of the glottis results in explosive exhalation. Effect: Dislodges and expels irritants from the airways.'

  'Mucociliary Clearance: the essential defense mechanism of the respiratory tract that involves the coordinated action of mucus production and ciliary movement to remove inhaled particles, pathogens, and debris from the respiratory airways.',
  'Mucus Layer: The mucosal lining of the respiratory tract, produced by goblet cells and submucosal glands, traps particles and microorganisms.',
  'Ciliary Action: The cilia are hair-like projections found on the epithelial cells lining the respiratory tract. They beat in a coordinated, wave-like manner to move the mucus, along with trapped particles, upward toward the pharynx.',
  'Function: This process ensures that foreign particles, such as dust, bacteria, and other contaminants, are transported to the throat, where they can be swallowed or expelled, keeping the airways clear and protecting the lungs from infection and inflammation.',
  'Mucociliar clearance: cells with cilia, 10Hz. Mucus above the epithel moves toward pharynx, 1mm/min. Fate of particles: > 5 μm, 5-2 μm, < 2 μm.',
  'Factors acting on mucociliar clearence: n. X, cold/heat, smoking, dehydration, dry air, anesthesia, drugs (atelectasia, infections, hypoxia).'

  'Alveolar Macrophages: Function: essential immune cells present in the alveolar spaces of the lungs. Their primary role is to protect the lungs from inhaled pathogens and particles. Mechanism: They phagocytize (engulf and ingest) particles that become trapped in the alveoli. Digestible Particles: If the particles are digestible, the macrophages break them down and release the by-products into the lymphatic system. Non-digestible Particles: If the particles cannot be digested, macrophages may form a "giant cell" capsule around them. This encapsulation prevents harm until the particle can potentially be dissolved over time. Significance: This function ensures that the alveolar environment remains clean and free from harmful agents, preventing infections and maintaining effective gas exchange. Alveolar macrophages: dust, smoke, silicium, asbestos (lysosomes).',
  'Clara Cells (Now Known as Club Cells): Location: These cells are found in the epithelium of the bronchioles. Functions: Secretion of Surfactant-like Material: Clara cells secrete a substance that reduces surface tension in the bronchioles, contributing to airway patency and preventing collapse. Detoxification: They have enzymatic properties that help detoxify harmful substances inhaled into the lungs. Regenerative Role: Clara cells can act as progenitor cells, capable of differentiating to replace damaged epithelial cells. Overall Role: They protect the bronchiolar epithelium by producing protective secretions and participating in tissue repair. Club (Clara) cells: surfactant production, stemcells.',
  'Tissue Mast Cells: Role in Immune Response: Mast cells are located in the connective tissues of the lung and play a pivotal role in allergic reactions and immune defense. Release of Substances: Histamine: Mast cells release histamine during allergic reactions, which can lead to increased mucus production, bronchoconstriction, and airway inflammation. Slow-reacting Substance of Anaphylaxis (e.g., leukotrienes): These compounds prolong the allergic response and contribute to sustained bronchoconstriction and mucus secretion. Function in Airway Protection: While their primary role is to defend against allergens and pathogens, excessive activation can contribute to airway obstruction, as seen in conditions like asthma. Tissue mast cells: histamin, allergy.'

  'Bronchomotor Tone: the baseline level of smooth muscle tension in the bronchial walls, which determines the diameter of the airways. It is constantly regulated by autonomic nervous system input, especially parasympathetic tone, which slightly constricts airways under resting conditions. Maintaining proper tone ensures optimal resistance and airflow regulation. Bronchomotor tone: n. X → constriction, diurnal rhythm (early morning asthma!) histamin. Non cholinergic parasy., circulating symp. mediators. → dilatation.',
  'β₂-Adrenergic Receptors (Predominant in Airways): Location: Bronchial smooth muscle and glandular epithelium. Effect: Bronchodilation (relaxes smooth muscle → increases airway diameter). Inhibits mucus secretion (modest drying effect). Inhibits mast cell degranulation (anti-inflammatory effect). Clinical use: β₂-agonists (e.g., salbutamol) are used to treat asthma and COPD.',
  'α-Adrenergic Receptors: Location: Nasal mucosa, submucosal vessels. Effect: Vasoconstriction in nasal passages (used in decongestants). Minor role in lower airways.',
  'Histamine: Source: Mast cells, basophils. Effect: Bronchoconstriction (via H₁ receptors). Increased vascular permeability → airway edema. Stimulates mucus secretion.',
  'Prostaglandins (e.g., PGD₂, PGE₂): Source: Arachidonic acid metabolism. Effect varies by type: PGD₂: Bronchoconstriction. PGE₂: Can cause bronchodilation or constriction, depending on receptor subtype.',
  'Leukotrienes (e.g., LTC₄, LTD₄): Source: Mast cells, eosinophils. Effect: Potent and prolonged bronchoconstriction. Increased mucus production. Airway edema. Clinical use: Leukotriene receptor antagonists (e.g., montelukast) are used in asthma therapy.'

  'Pulmonary capillary endothelium: plays an important role in filtering and metabolizing vasoactive substances that enter the lungs with venous blood. Some are efficiently cleared, while others pass through unchanged. Physical filtering: pulmonary capillaries, Ø 7 µm. Role in hemostase: plasminogen activators, heparin, thromboplastin. Neutralizing vasoactive substances: serotonin, NA, bradykinin, prostaglandins, adenozin.',
  'Substances That Are Efficiently Cleared in the Lungs: Leukotrienes – inactivated; involved in bronchoconstriction and inflammation. Prostanoids (e.g., PGF₂α) – metabolized; affect vasodilation and inflammation. Bradykinin – rapidly degraded by ACE; increases vascular permeability. VIP (Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide) – inactivated; causes smooth muscle relaxation. Endothelin – partially removed; a potent vasoconstrictor. Serotonin (5-HT) – ~80% taken up by pulmonary endothelium and platelets.',
  'Substances That Pass Through the Lungs Unchanged: Adrenaline (Epinephrine) – systemic hormone; passes unchanged. Vasopressin (ADH) – systemic hormone; passes unchanged. Angiotensin I – converted into Angiotensin II by ACE in pulmonary endothelium.'

  'Pulmonary vascular endothelium: plays a crucial role in the production of angiotensin II through the expression and action of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). This enzyme is primarily located on the surface of the endothelial cells lining the pulmonary capillaries and serves a key function in the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), which is important for regulating blood pressure and fluid balance.',
  'Site of ACE Expression: The pulmonary endothelium is one of the most significant sites for ACE expression in the body. This strategic location ensures efficient conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II as blood flows through the lungs.',
  'Conversion Process: When blood containing angiotensin I passes through the lung capillaries, ACE catalyzes the conversion of angiotensin I (an inactive decapeptide) to angiotensin II (an active octapeptide). ACE: Angiotensin I. → Angiotensin II. (blood pressure control).',
  'Function of Angiotensin II: Vasoconstriction: Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor, which increases systemic vascular resistance and raises blood pressure. Aldosterone Secretion: It stimulates the adrenal cortex to release aldosterone, which promotes sodium and water retention in the kidneys, contributing to an increase in blood volume and pressure. Fluid and Electrolyte Balance: Angiotensin II also influences the balance of fluids and electrolytes, helping maintain homeostasis.',
  'Regulation of Blood Pressure: By producing angiotensin II, the pulmonary endothelium plays an essential role in maintaining blood pressure, especially under conditions where increased blood pressure is needed, such as during dehydration or blood loss.'
