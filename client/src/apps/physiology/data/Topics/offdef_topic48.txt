  'Resting tone: the sum of basal tone and neurogenic tone.',
  'Basal tone: the spontaneous contractile activity of smooth muscle independent of nerve or hormonal influences. Source: Intrinsic property of smooth muscle. Significance: It sets the baseline vascular resistance.',
  'Neurogenic tone: the level of vascular smooth muscle contraction caused by autonomic nervous system input, primarily sympathetic nervous system activity. Mechanism: Norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerves binds to alpha-adrenergic receptors, causing vasoconstriction. Importance: Allows dynamic regulation of blood flow according to the body\'s demands.',
  'Myogenic tone: the vascular smooth muscle\'s response to changes in transmural pressure (pressure across the vessel wall). Mechanism: Stretch of the vessel wall activates stretch-sensitive ion channels in smooth muscle cells. This causes depolarization and calcium influx, leading to vasoconstriction (Bayliss effect). Role: Helps stabilize blood flow despite changes in blood pressure (autoregulation).'

  'Sympathetic vasomotor tone: refers to the continuous partial state of contraction in vascular smooth muscle maintained by the tonic activity of the sympathetic nervous system. It plays a critical role in regulating systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and, consequently, blood pressure.',
  'Origin: The sympathetic vasomotor tone originates from the vasomotor center, located in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. This center integrates inputs from higher brain centers (e.g., hypothalamus, cortex), baroreceptors, and chemoreceptors. It continuously generates tonic efferent signals to maintain a baseline level of vascular tone. The origin of the sympathetic tone resides in the medulla.',
  'Pathway: Signals travel via preganglionic sympathetic neurons in the thoracolumbar spinal cord. Preganglionic neurons synapse with postganglionic sympathetic neurons in the paravertebral sympathetic chain ganglia or prevertebral ganglia.',
  'Neurotransmitter: Norepinephrine (NE) is the primary neurotransmitter released from postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals. In some vessels, the adrenal medulla releases epinephrine, contributing to vascular tone regulation.',
  'Receptor: Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors are the primary receptors mediating vasoconstriction. Found on vascular smooth muscle cells of arterioles and veins. Mechanism: Norepinephrine binds to alpha-1 receptors. This activates the Gq protein pathway, leading to increased intracellular calcium via the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Smooth muscle contraction and vasoconstriction.',
  'Physiological significance: Sympathetic vasomotor tone ensures a minimum level of systemic vascular resistance, maintaining blood pressure under resting conditions. It adapts to changing physiological demands, such as during exercise, stress, or blood loss. It allows the redistribution of blood flow to meet the metabolic demands of different organs under resting and stress conditions, such as exercise, hemorrhage, or thermoregulation.',
  'Organ circulations where sympathetic vasomotor tone is significant: Skin (critical for thermoregulation, sympathetic tone causes vasoconstriction in cold conditions to conserve heat and vasodilation in heat for cooling, vasoconstriction during stress helps redirect blood flow to vital organs). Skeletal muscle (maintains vascular resistance during rest and directs blood flow during exercise, rest: sympathetic tone keeps skeletal muscle arterioles constricted, maintaining systemic vascular resistance, exercise: local metabolic factors override sympathetic tone, increasing blood flow). Splanchnic circulation (gastrointestinal and liver, acts as a reservoir for blood redistribution during stress or hemorrhage, sympathetic stimulation causes intense vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow to the GI tract and liver while increasing it to skeletal muscle and the heart).',
  'Organ circulations where sympathetic vasomotor tone is negligible: Coronary circulation (coronary blood flow is primarily regulated by local metabolic factors such as oxygen demand and adenosine, sympathetic stimulation has minimal vasoconstrictor effects on coronary vessels due to local metabolic autoregulation overriding sympathetic tone). Brain (cerebral blood flow is tightly regulated by metabolic needs such as CO₂ levels and pH rather than sympathetic tone, excessive vasoconstriction would impair brain perfusion, so sympathetic influence on cerebral circulation is negligible). Kidney (autoregulation predominates in maintaining renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate over a wide range of blood pressures, sympathetic tone is significant only during severe stress or hemorrhage, where it reduces renal blood flow to conserve blood volume).'

  'Baroreceptors: spray-type nerve endings that lie in the walls of the arteries and are stimulated when stretched. Located in the walls of the carotid sinus (near the bifurcation of the common carotid artery) and the aortic arch. Function: They are mechanoreceptors sensitive to changes in arterial pressure. When arterial pressure increases, these receptors detect the stretch in the arterial walls.',
  'Sensitivity: The carotid sinus baroreceptors respond to a pressure range of 50–180 mmHg, with maximal sensitivity at 100 mmHg. The aortic arch baroreceptors have a similar response but are activated at approximately 30 mmHg higher pressures than the carotid sinus.',
  'Response properties: Nerve endings respond to mean pressure, pulse pressure (i.e. SABP-DABP), and rate of change of pressure (dP/dt). Actually, they respond to pressure-induced changes in wall tension: carotid massage can interfere with the receptors.',
  'Afferent nerves: Signals from the carotid sinus travel via the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the medulla. Signals from the aortic arch travel via the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) to the same NTS.',
  'Nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS): The primary site for afferent input from the baroreceptors. Integrates sensory information and modulates autonomic output.',
  'Sympathetic pathway connections: Initial input to nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS). Excitatory connection to caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM). Inhibitory connection to rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM). The NTS sends inhibitory signals to the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), which decreases sympathetic outflow. Rostral ventrolateral Medulla (RVLM) is the generator of sympathetic tone. Caudal ventrolateral medulla (CVLM) provides inhibition of RVLM.',
  'Parasympathetic pathway connections: Initial input to nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS). Excitatory connection to dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (dmnX). Excitatory connection to nucleus ambiguus (nA). The NTS excites the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and the nucleus ambiguus, enhancing parasympathetic (vagal) activity.',
  'Sympathetic efferents: Inhibited by the baroreceptor reflex when arterial pressure is high. Leads to reduced stimulation of arterioles, veins, and the heart. The sympathetic innervates heart (atria+ventricles) and vessels (arterioles and veins). Sympathetics have an exclusive role in the regulation of TPR.',
  'Parasympathetic efferents: Activated via the vagus nerve. Results in decreased heart rate (negative chronotropy) and reduced cardiac output. The parasympathetic innervates heart (atria only).',
  'Effects on heart: Increased parasympathetic activity decreases heart rate (via vagus nerve). Decreased sympathetic activity reduces myocardial contractility (negative inotropy).',
  'Effects on arterioles: Decreased sympathetic tone causes vasodilation, lowering total peripheral resistance (TPR).',
  'Effects on veins: Decreased sympathetic tone causes venodilation, reducing venous return and cardiac preload.',
  'Summary of high arterial pressure response: Activates baroreceptors → Signals to NTS → Inhibition of RVLM and activation of parasympathetic centers → Reduced heart rate, vasodilation, and venodilation → Decrease in arterial pressure.',
  'Summary of low arterial pressure response: Decreases baroreceptor firing → Reduced inhibition of RVLM → Increased sympathetic outflow → Increased heart rate, vasoconstriction, and venoconstriction → Increase in arterial pressure.'

  'The high-pressure baroreceptor reflex is crucial for short-term regulation of arterial blood pressure. It acts as a rapid, negative feedback mechanism that stabilizes blood pressure in response to sudden changes, such as those caused by posture shifts, blood loss, or stress.',

  'Lying down to standing up (orthostasis): Gravity causes blood to pool in the lower extremities and veins. Venous return to the heart decreases, reducing stroke volume and cardiac output (Frank-Starling mechanism). This transiently lowers arterial blood pressure, especially in the upper body, including the brain. If uncorrected, the reduced cerebral perfusion can cause dizziness or fainting (orthostatic hypotension). When standing up, venous volume increases by 500 ml, decreasing venous flow to the heart (venous return).',
  'Standing up to lying down: The horizontal position eliminates gravitational pooling of blood. Venous return increases, resulting in a transient rise in cardiac output and BP. Without regulation, this could lead to unnecessary cardiac strain.',
  'Baroreceptor response to lying down → standing up: Decreased arterial pressure reduces stretch on the baroreceptors. Firing rate of afferent nerves (glossopharyngeal and vagus) decreases.',
  'Baroreceptor response to standing up → lying down: Increased arterial pressure stretches the baroreceptors. Firing rate of afferent nerves increases.',
  'Integration: Afferent signals from baroreceptors are processed in the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the medulla. The NTS modulates sympathetic outflow (via the rostral ventrolateral medulla, RVLM) and parasympathetic outflow (via the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus).',
  'Compensation for orthostasis (lying down → standing up): Decreased baroreceptor firing activates the sympathetic nervous system. Heart: Increases heart rate (positive chronotropy) and contractility (positive inotropy) → increases cardiac output. Arterioles: Vasoconstriction increases total peripheral resistance (TPR) → helps maintain arterial pressure. Veins: Venoconstriction reduces venous pooling and increases venous return (preload). Simultaneously, parasympathetic activity is reduced.',
  'Compensation for increased venous return (standing up → lying down): Increased baroreceptor firing suppresses the sympathetic nervous system and activates the parasympathetic nervous system. Heart: Decreases heart rate (negative chronotropy) and cardiac output. Arterioles: Vasodilation reduces TPR, preventing an excessive rise in BP. Veins: Reduced sympathetic tone decreases venous return.'

  'Peripheral chemoreceptors: Location: Carotid bodies (at the bifurcation of the carotid arteries) and aortic bodies (near the aortic arch). Stimuli: Hypoxia (low PO₂), hypercapnia (high PCO₂), and acidosis (low pH). Afferent pathways: Signals are transmitted via the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) and vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the medulla.',
  'Central chemoreceptors: Location: Medulla oblongata, near the respiratory centers. Stimuli: Primarily sensitive to hypercapnia (high CO₂) and resulting acidosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Mechanism: Increased PCO₂ leads to the formation of carbonic acid, lowering CSF pH and stimulating chemoreceptors.',
  'Hypoxia-induced reflexes: Goal: Increase oxygen delivery to tissues. Cardiovascular effects: Heart: Increased heart rate (tachycardia), mediated by sympathetic activation. Arterioles: Peripheral vasoconstriction (except in the brain and heart) to shunt blood toward vital organs. Respiration: Increased respiratory rate and depth (hyperventilation) to improve oxygen uptake.',
  'Hypercapnia-induced reflexes: Goal: Increase CO₂ elimination and oxygen delivery. Cardiovascular effects: Increased sympathetic activity → Vasoconstriction in non-vital areas. Modest tachycardia to increase cardiac output. Respiratory effects: Hyperventilation to eliminate CO₂ and restore pH balance.',
  'Major function of chemoreceptor reflexes: The major function of these reflexes is the stimulation of breathing. Only very severe hypotension (below 60-80 mmHg) results in hypoxia/hypercapnia that is capable of eliciting significant vasoconstriction through chemoreceptors.',
  'CNS ischemic pressor response (Cushing reflex): an emergency reflex activated by severe cerebral ischemia, typically due to elevated intracranial pressure (ICP).',
  'Stimulus for Cushing reflex: Increased ICP compresses cerebral blood vessels, leading to cerebral ischemia (reduced blood flow). Trigger: Hypoxia and hypercapnia in the medulla, caused by reduced cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). CPP = Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) - Intracranial Pressure (ICP). If ICP approaches MAP, cerebral perfusion ceases.',
  'Activation mechanism: Severe ischemia and hypercapnia stimulate central chemoreceptors and medullary neurons, activating the sympathetic nervous system.',
  'Cardiovascular effects of Cushing reflex: Systemic vasoconstriction: Generalized arteriolar constriction raises MAP to maintain cerebral blood flow despite high ICP. Bradycardia: The baroreceptor reflex is activated by the rise in MAP, causing increased vagal stimulation to slow the heart rate. Respiratory irregularities: Medullary ischemia disrupts normal respiratory rhythm, causing irregular breathing patterns (Cheyne-Stokes respiration or apnea).',
  'Stages of Cushing reflex: Initial compensation: Increased sympathetic activity temporarily restores CPP. Progressive ICP rise: Further compression of brain structures reduces perfusion and oxygenation. Failure of compensation: If ICP exceeds MAP, perfusion ceases, leading to brainstem herniation and death.'
