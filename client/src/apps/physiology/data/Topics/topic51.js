      examAnswer: 'Skeletal muscle circulation is regulated by both systemic neural and local control mechanisms whose relative importance shifts between rest and exercise. At rest, systemic neural control predominates through sympathetic nervous system tonic vasoconstrictor tone via norepinephrine acting on alpha-one adrenergic receptors, maintaining vascular resistance and systemic blood pressure while limiting skeletal muscle blood flow to approximately 20 to 25 percent of cardiac output. During exercise, local control mechanisms become predominant through metabolic vasodilation where active muscles release metabolites including adenosine, potassium, hydrogen ions, lactate, and carbon dioxide that cause precapillary arteriolar dilation. This phenomenon called functional sympatholysis allows local metabolites to override sympathetic vasoconstriction, ensuring adequate perfusion to exercising muscles despite global sympathetic activation, increasing skeletal muscle blood flow to 80 to 90 percent of cardiac output during intense exercise. Additional local mechanisms include myogenic response where arterioles respond to pressure changes, and flow-mediated vasodilation where shear stress triggers endothelial nitric oxide release.'

      examAnswer: 'Exercise produces profound cardiovascular consequences affecting multiple parameters. Total peripheral resistance decreases during exercise due to widespread vasodilation in active skeletal muscles driven by local metabolites including adenosine, carbon dioxide, hydrogen ions, and potassium through functional sympatholysis, while vasoconstriction in non-essential tissues helps maintain systemic resistance. Cardiac output at rest is approximately 5 to 6 liters per minute but increases dramatically during exercise to 20 to 25 liters per minute in untrained individuals or 35 to 40 liters per minute in highly trained athletes through combined increases in heart rate driven by parasympathetic withdrawal and sympathetic activation with maximal heart rate approximately 220 minus age, and stroke volume enhanced by venous return via muscle and respiratory pumps plus increased myocardial contractility. Arteriovenous oxygen difference at rest is approximately 5 milliliters oxygen per deciliter blood but increases significantly to 15 to 17 milliliters oxygen per deciliter blood during exercise due to increased capillary recruitment, mitochondrial activity, and enhanced oxygen unloading from hemoglobin via the Bohr effect from decreased pH and increased local carbon dioxide and temperature. Arterial pressure shows systolic pressure increasing proportionally with exercise intensity reaching 180 to 200 millimeters mercury, while diastolic pressure remains unchanged or slightly decreases due to reduced peripheral resistance, resulting in slight increase in mean arterial pressure. Regarding skeletal muscle contribution, at rest skeletal muscles receive 20 to 25 percent of cardiac output approximately 1 to 1.5 liters per minute, but during maximal exercise this increases to 80 to 90 percent of cardiac output approximately 20 to 30 liters per minute.'

Consequences: Reduced gastrointestinal motility and absorption. Temporary ischemia in prolonged exercise may cause gastrointestinal discomfort.',

As exercise continues, cutaneous blood flow increases for thermoregulation: Heat produced by working muscles is dissipated through the skin.

      examAnswer: 'During sustained exercise such as distance running, cardiac output undergoes significant redistribution to prioritize active muscles while maintaining vital organ perfusion. Skeletal muscle receives 80 to 90 percent of cardiac output during sustained exercise compared to approximately 20 percent at rest, with blood flow reaching 20 to 30 liters per minute driven by local metabolic vasodilation from adenosine, potassium, carbon dioxide, lactate, and hydrogen ions, plus hypoxia, working through functional sympatholysis. Cerebral circulation maintains or slightly increases blood flow at approximately 750 milliliters per minute or 13 to 15 percent of cardiac output through autoregulation ensuring constant perfusion across wide blood pressure ranges, with increased arterial carbon dioxide levels during exercise enhancing cerebral vasodilation. Coronary circulation increases blood flow proportionally to increased myocardial oxygen demand, with flow increasing 3 to 4 times during exercise via local metabolic vasodilation particularly adenosine release, combined with sympathetic stimulation increasing heart rate and contractility necessitating increased coronary perfusion. Splanchnic circulation shows decreased blood flow falling from approximately 25 percent of cardiac output at rest to 3 to 5 percent during sustained exercise through sympathetic-mediated vasoconstriction of splanchnic arteries, with redistribution prioritizing active muscles over digestive functions, potentially causing gastrointestinal discomfort in prolonged exercise. Cutaneous circulation displays dynamic changes initially decreasing due to sympathetic vasoconstriction, but later increasing for thermoregulation as heat produced by working muscles requires dissipation through skin along with sweat production, with blood flow tightly regulated to balance thermoregulation with maintaining perfusion of vital organs and muscles.'
