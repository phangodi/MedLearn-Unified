        'Tight junctions, located at the interface between adjacent epithelial cells, regulate the paracellular transport of solutes and water. Their functional properties differ between "leaky" and "tight" epithelia, which are adapted to distinct roles in the nephron.',
        'Tight Junctions in Leaky Epithelia: Permeability: Tight junctions in leaky epithelia are highly permeable, allowing significant paracellular transport of water and solutes. Function: Support bulk reabsorption of filtered solutes and water. Facilitate passive movement of small solutes like sodium (Na⁺), chloride (Cl⁻), and water.',
        'Examples of Leaky Epithelia in the Nephron: Proximal tubule: Accounts for reabsorption of ~65-70% of filtered sodium and water. Paracellular pathways complement transcellular transport mechanisms. Important for reclaiming glucose, amino acids, and bicarbonate. Descending limb of the loop of Henle: Specialized for passive water reabsorption, aiding in tubular fluid concentration. Solutes are not reabsorbed paracellularly in this segment.',
        'We assume that "leaky tight junctions" are in the proximal tubules. The entry of Na+ in the cell is a carrier-mediated process and is driven by an electrochemical gradient. Cl follows the movement of Na+ because of the electrochemical gradient and water enters because of the osmotic gradient.',
        'Highly Water Permeable Epithelia (e.g. proximal tubule): Iso-osmotic Absorption. Epithelia that transport large amounts of solute and water have long and highly enfolded lateral intercellular spaces. The apical surface area is usually enhanced by long and numerous microvilli called the brush border. It reduces the amount of fluid in one compartment and add fluid to another compartment without changing the ionic composition of either compartment.',
        'Tight Junctions in Tight Epithelia: Permeability: Tight junctions in tight epithelia are highly restrictive, minimizing paracellular transport and controlling selective movement. Function: Allow precise control over solute and water transport. Regulated by hormones, such as aldosterone (for Na⁺ reabsorption) and ADH (for water reabsorption).',
        'Examples of Tight Epithelia in the Nephron: Distal convoluted tubule: Tight junctions maintain low permeability to water and solutes. Facilitates fine-tuning of sodium and chloride reabsorption. Collecting duct: Tight junctions regulate water permeability based on antidiuretic hormone (ADH) action. Ensures efficient water conservation when needed.',
        'Water Impermeable Epithelia: These epithelia have low water permeability of their apical surfaces. They transport a solution that is strongly hypertonic. Hyper-osmotic Absorption: In these epithelia salts are absorbed but not water. The net effect is that salt is removed from the luminal compartment into the interstitial fluid without changing the amount of fluid in each compartment. Examples of this kind of epithelium are the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle and the distal nephron. In some epithelia water permeability is regulated.',
        'Water Movement Driven by Solutes: Leaky epithelia: High paracellular permeability allows water to follow solutes like sodium and chloride, maintaining osmotic gradients. Tight epithelia: Water movement occurs transcellularly through aquaporins, regulated by hormones (e.g., ADH in the collecting duct).'
