Initiation: voluntary movement controlled by the cerebral cortex and brainstem motor centers. The trigeminal nerve (cranial nerve V) innervates the jaw muscles responsible for biting. Muscular control: the masseter and temporalis muscles contract to close the jaw forcefully; the pterygoid muscles assist in jaw stabilization and positioning. Incisors (front teeth) provide a strong cutting action; molars (back teeth) generate crushing and grinding of food.',

A small pressure gauge is placed inside the esophagus and the pressure is measured (clinically, pressure above 40 mmHg in the LES region is indicative of achalasia).

        'Why luminal pressure varies with the respiratory cycle: The esophagus lies within the thoracic cavity, so its intraluminal pressure reflects intrapleural pressure changes. During inspiration: intrapleural pressure becomes more negative (~−7 to −10 mmHg); esophageal pressure decreases due to lung expansion and downward diaphragm movement. During expiration: intrapleural pressure becomes less negative (~−2 to −5 mmHg); esophageal pressure increases as the diaphragm relaxes. The diaphragm also mechanically reinforces the LES during inspiration, helping prevent gastric reflux. Increased intra-abdominal pressure (e.g., during straining or coughing) can elevate LES pressure to prevent reflux.'
