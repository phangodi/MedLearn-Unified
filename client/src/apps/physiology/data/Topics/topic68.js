Regional patterns: (1) Coecum, colon ascendens, proximal colon transversum: antiperistalsis, in 10-15 min intervals (ileocecal valve). (2) Distal colon transversum, colon descendens: slow anal propulsion - haustra (~segmentation). (3) Colon sigmoideum, rectum: tonic contractions for a longer segment - elimination.',
        'Haustration (Segmentation Contractions): segmental contractions in the colon that form saclike pouches called haustra. Seen most prominently in the cecum and proximal colon, but can be observed along the entire colon. Mechanism: the circular layer of smooth muscle contracts, narrowing the lumen; the longitudinal muscle is arranged in three distinct bands called the teniae coli; when the teniae coli contract simultaneously with the circular muscle, the bowel wall bulges outward, creating the haustra. Function: haustrations churn the fecal material, repeatedly exposing it to the mucosal surface, maximizing water and electrolyte absorption; also provides minor forward movement toward the transverse colon.',
        'Antiperistalsis: Location: mainly transverse and descending colon. Function: delays colonic transit. Contractions move contents backward (toward cecum), slowing transit to allow more water reabsorption and bacterial fermentation, and helping retain feces until appropriate for defecation. Mechanism: smooth muscle contracts in the reverse direction (opposite of normal aborad propulsion); local ENS reflexes trigger these reverse waves, often in response to the need for more contact time.',
        'Mass movement (mass peristalsis): powerful, coordinated contractions that move fecal contents over long distances in the colon - often from the transverse colon to the sigmoid colon or rectum. Trigger & frequency: typically occur 1-3 times per day, often after meals due to the gastrocolic and duodenocolic reflexes; the presence of food in the stomach or duodenum activates reflex arcs via the parasympathetic nervous system and hormones (e.g., gastrin, CCK). A constrictive ring forms in response to distention (usually in the transverse colon); the segment distal to the ring then contracts as a unit for ~30 seconds, propelling feces forward "en masse"; this cycle can repeat several times over 10-30 minutes. The most powerful trigger is the gastrocolic reflex.',
        'Defecation: the final act of the digestive process, resulting in the voluntary expulsion of feces from the rectum through the anus. As mass movements push feces into the rectum, the rectal wall stretches, initiating the rectosphincteric reflex - causing the internal anal sphincter (smooth muscle) to relax. The external anal sphincter (skeletal muscle) is under somatic (voluntary) control. Defecation occurs only if the external sphincter is voluntarily relaxed.'

        'Defecation reflex - reflex arc components: Receptor: mechanoreceptors of the anal canal. Afferents: ENS sensory cell fibers. Center: sacral spinal cord, medulla, hypothalamus, cortex. Efferents: pudendal nerve, pelvic nerve. Effector organs: skeletal muscle (levator ani) - position; abdominal pressure increase, inspiration; relaxation of anal sphincters (55 mmHg). Distension produces passive tension due to stretching of the wall of the rectum, and additional active tension when smooth muscle contracts.',
        'Defecation reflex mechanism: parasympathetic reflex elicited by distention of the rectum (1 & 2). (1) Feces entering the sigmoid or rectum stretches the wall; stretch receptors (mechanoreceptors) are activated, sending signals via ENS sensory fibers. (2) Parasympathetic fibers (via pelvic nerve) trigger contraction of the sigmoid/rectum wall and relaxation of the internal anal sphincter (smooth muscle, involuntary, innervated by the autonomic nervous system). (3) The external anal sphincter (voluntary striated skeletal muscle, innervated by the pudendal nerve/somatic nervous system) can allow defecation or voluntarily contract to temporarily stop the reflex.',
        'Voluntary control of defecation: the external anal sphincter (EAS) is composed of striated muscle and is controlled voluntarily via the pudendal nerve. If defecation is not socially appropriate, voluntary contraction of the EAS and pelvic floor muscles can override the reflex and prevent bowel movement. When defecation is desired, conscious relaxation of the EAS occurs. Valsalva maneuver: taking a deep breath, closing the glottis, and contracting abdominal muscles increases intra-abdominal pressure, aiding in expelling feces. Pelvic floor relaxation: the pelvic floor muscles (e.g., puborectalis) relax, straightening the anorectal angle and facilitating fecal passage. Signals from the cerebral cortex (conscious control) travel down the corticospinal tracts to control defecation.',
        'Passive incontinence: involuntary leakage of feces without sensation, often due to rectal overdistension or nerve damage affecting internal anal sphincter (IAS) function.',
        'Active incontinence: involuntary loss of feces despite an attempt to control it, typically due to dysfunction of the external anal sphincter (EAS) or weakened pelvic floor muscles.'
