        'Overview: The entire surface of the stomach mucosa between glands has a continuous layer of a special type of mucous cells called "surface mucous cells." They secrete large quantities of viscid mucus that coats the stomach mucosa with a gel layer of mucus often more than 1 millimeter thick, thus providing a major shell of protection for the stomach wall, as well as contributing to lubrication of food transport. Another characteristic of this mucus is that it is alkaline. Therefore, the normal underlying stomach wall is not directly exposed to the highly acidic, proteolytic stomach secretion.',
        'Mucosal Barrier (Physical Protection): Mucus Secretion - surface mucous cells and mucous neck cells secrete a thick layer of viscid mucus that forms a gel-like coating (>1 mm) over the gastric epithelium; this mucus layer physically separates the epithelial cells from gastric acid and digestive enzymes. Mucus composition: water (95%), electrolytes (sodium, potassium), phospholipids, mucin proteins (most important - increases viscosity and forms the thick mucosal barrier). Tight Junctions - epithelial cells are tightly connected by tight junctions, preventing back-diffusion of H⁺ ions and stopping acid from penetrating the gastric mucosa.',
        'Chemical Protection: Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) Secretion - surface mucous cells secrete alkaline bicarbonate which gets trapped within the mucus layer; if any H⁺ penetrates the mucus, it is neutralized by HCO₃⁻ (H⁺ + HCO₃⁻ → H₂CO₃ → CO₂ + H₂O) before reaching epithelial cells; ensures the immediate environment of the epithelium remains near-neutral pH even though gastric lumen pH is 1-2. Prostaglandins (PGE₂): stimulate HCO₃⁻ and mucus secretion, enhance mucosal blood flow, and inhibit excessive H⁺ secretion from parietal cells. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which can lead to gastric ulcers.',
        'Cellular Protection and Repair: Epithelial Cell Renewal - gastric epithelium has a high turnover rate, with cells being replaced every 3-7 days; helps quickly repair minor damage before it leads to ulcers. Mucosal Blood Flow - adequate blood flow provides essential nutrients and oxygen, supporting rapid repair; removes back-diffused acid, preventing excessive H⁺ accumulation.',
        'Factors that impair the mucosal barrier and may result in ulcer or perforation: Vasoconstriction, Glucocorticoids, Salicylic acid (aspirin), Ethyl alcohol, Helicobacter pylori. Inhibition of PGE₂ synthesis impairs the mucosal barrier.'
