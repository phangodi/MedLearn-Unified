  'GIS basic functions: 1. Motility (striated and smooth muscles): mechanical breakdown, storage, mixing, propulsion, excretion. 2. Secretion 7-8 L/day! (mucosal glands, salivary glands, liver, pancreas). 3. Digestion (enzymatic hydrolysis). 4. Absorption 8-9 L/day! (macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, water).',
  'Additional GIS roles: Maintenance of the gut flora: cca. 500 species of bacteria, 30-40 common. High importance immune organ GALT: gut-associated lymphoid tissue, 70-80% of the immune cells are found here: immune response and tolerance.',
  'Special forms of control: neural: CNS (somatic motor and autonomic) and the enteral nervous system (ENS), humoral control: paracrine mediators and special endocrine system (gastrointestinal hormones).',

Prox. stomach storage: CNS parasympathetic. Colon motility: CNS. Distal colon and rectum: ENS, CNS parasympathetic and somatic motor (outer anal sphincter).',

  'Enteral nervous system (ENS) general characteristics: The gastrointestinal tract has a nervous system all its own called the enteric nervous system. It lies entirely in the wall of the gut, beginning in the esophagus and extending all the way to the anus. The number of neurons in this enteric system is greater than 100 million, more than the number in the entire spinal cord. In humans 4-600 MILLION neurons, similar to that of spinal cord! ("visceral brain" aka "brain in the gut"). This highly developed enteric nervous system is especially important in controlling gastrointestinal movements and secretion.',
  'ENS development: The enteral neurons stem from the parasympathetic (mainly vagal) portions of the neural crest; the sacral origin neuronal population is important in the hindgut.',
  'ENS plexuses – anatomical position: The enteric nervous system is composed mainly of two plexuses: (1) an outer plexus lying between the longitudinal and circular muscle layers, called the myenteric plexus or Auerbach\'s plexus; and (2) an inner plexus, called the submucosal plexus or Meissner\'s plexus, which lies in the submucosa. (Myentericus pl is present from esophagus; submucosal from the stomach on.)',
  'Myenteric plexus (Auerbach\'s plexus) – function: The myenteric plexus controls mainly the gastrointestinal movements. The myenteric plexus consists mostly of a linear chain of many interconnecting neurons that extends the entire length of the gastrointestinal tract. Because it lies between the longitudinal and circular layers of intestinal smooth muscle, it is concerned mainly with controlling muscle activity along the length of the gut. When stimulated, its principal effects are: (1) increased tonic contraction, or "tone," of the gut wall; (2) increased intensity of the rhythmic contractions; (3) slightly increased rate of the rhythm of contraction; and (4) increased velocity of conduction of excitatory waves along the gut wall. The myenteric plexus should not be considered entirely excitatory because some of its neurons are inhibitory; their fiber endings secrete an inhibitory transmitter, possibly vasoactive intestinal polypeptide or some other inhibitory peptide. Inhibitory signals are especially useful for inhibiting some intestinal sphincter muscles (pyloric sphincter, sphincter of the ileocecal valve).',
  'Submucosal plexus (Meissner\'s plexus) – function: The submucosal plexus controls mainly gastrointestinal secretion and local blood flow. It is mainly concerned with controlling function in the inner wall of each minute segment of the intestine. Many sensory signals originate from the gastrointestinal epithelium and are integrated in the submucosal plexus to help control local intestinal secretion, local absorption, and local contraction of the submucosal muscle that causes various degrees of infolding of the gastrointestinal mucosa.',
  'Major ENS neuron types (cellular divisions of enteric ganglia): 1. Intrinsic sensory neurons (IPANs): sensitive to mechanical and/or chemical stimuli from the mucosa; also stretch-sensitive receptors in the muscle layers. 2. Interneurons: excitatory or inhibitory. 3. Excitatory or inhibitory effector neurons controlling the smooth muscle and glands. Complicated reflex pathways.',
  'Afferent sensory nerve fibers from the gut: Many afferent sensory nerve fibers innervate the gut. Some have their cell bodies in the enteric nervous system, and some have them in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord. These sensory nerves can be stimulated by (1) irritation of the gut mucosa, (2) excessive gut distention, or (3) the presence of specific chemical substances in the gut. Signals transmitted through the fibers can cause excitation or inhibition of intestinal movements or intestinal secretion. Note: 80% of the nerve fibers in the vagus nerves are afferent rather than efferent.',

  'Key principle – fiber type distinction: The parasympathetic nerves innervate the GIS with PREganglionic fibers; some ENS neurons may be regarded as parasympathetic ganglion cells. The sympathetic nerves innervate the GIS with POSTganglionic fibers. Therefore, the parasympathetic effects can take place ONLY through the ENS, while sympathetic effect will take place MAINLY through the ENS (some direct effect).',
  'Parasympathetic input to ENS: Parasympathetic control comes from the vagus nerve (cranial division) and pelvic splanchnic nerves (sacral division). Cranial division (vagus nerve): supplies the esophagus, stomach, pancreas, small intestine, and the proximal half of the large intestine. Sacral division (pelvic splanchnic nerves): supplies the distal colon, rectum, and anus. Preganglionic parasympathetic fibers release acetylcholine (ACh), which activates nicotinic receptors on ENS postganglionic neurons. Postganglionic fibers within the ENS can be: cholinergic (ACh release – excitatory) or peptidergic (e.g., VIP, GRP – inhibitory effects).',
  'Parasympathetic effects on GIS: Increased motility: ACh activation of myenteric neurons stimulates rhythmic peristaltic contractions, enhances segmentation and mixing. Increased secretion: stimulates digestive enzymes, mucus, bicarbonate, and gastric acid (via GRP). Enhanced blood flow to the mucosa.',
  'Sympathetic input to ENS: Sympathetic fibers originate from thoracic (T5-T12) and lumbar (L1-L2) spinal segments; synapse in the celiac, superior mesenteric, and inferior mesenteric ganglia. Preganglionic fibers release ACh (nicotinic receptors in sympathetic ganglia). Postganglionic fibers release norepinephrine (NE) acting on adrenergic receptors. Direct inhibition via alpha-adrenergic receptors; indirect inhibition via suppression of ENS neurons (α2 receptor). Adrenergic neurons of the sympathetic nerves can exert direct constrictor effects on vascular smooth muscle and sphincters (α1 receptor).',
  'Sympathetic effects on GIS: Decreased motility: norepinephrine suppresses myenteric plexus activity, resulting in decreased peristalsis; strong sympathetic activation can cause near-complete cessation of gut motility. Decreased secretion: inhibition of the submucosal plexus. Contraction of sphincters: pyloric sphincter and anal sphincter contract, delaying gastric emptying and defecation. Reduced blood flow: vasoconstriction in the GI tract.',
  'GIS is innervated by primary sensor neurons of the somatic sensory system as well. Thus, the CNS receives sensory information about GIS events. Through autonomic innervation, the CNS will modulate GIS functions (gut-brain-gut axis).',

  'Local reflex: All involved neurons are part of the ENS; the reflex is integrated within the gut wall (e.g., gut peristalsis). Reflex arc: sensory neurons in the gut wall (mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, osmoreceptors) detect changes → signals relayed to ENS interneurons → motor neurons regulate smooth muscle contraction, secretion, and blood flow. Excitatory neurotransmitters: acetylcholine (ACh), substance P → stimulate motility and secretion. Inhibitory neurotransmitters: nitric oxide (NO), vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) → relax smooth muscle and inhibit secretion.',
  'Short reflex: The afferent is a primary sensory neuron originating from the GIS; the reflex is integrated OUTSIDE the CNS, in the autonomic sympathetic ganglion; the efferent is a sympathetic postganglionic neuron. These reflexes are inhibitory (e.g., painful stretch inhibits gut motility). Example: in the ileogastric reflex, distension of the ileum sends inhibitory signals via sympathetic ganglia, leading to reduced gastric motility.',
  'Long reflexes: The reflex is integrated in the CNS through the brainstem or the spinal cord. Can be excitatory or inhibitory. Special subtype is the "vagovagal reflex," where both the afferents and the (parasympathetic) efferents are found in the vagal nerve. Reflex arc: sensory input from the GI tract via afferent fibers (vagal, pelvic, or splanchnic nerves) → CNS (brainstem or spinal cord) → efferent signals back via parasympathetic (vagal, pelvic) or sympathetic (splanchnic) pathways.',
  'Neurotransmitters in long reflexes – parasympathetic pathways: ACh (via vagus or pelvic nerves) activates ENS neurons → increased motility and secretion. Peptides such as gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) or VIP modulate secretion and motility. Sympathetic pathways: norepinephrine (via splanchnic nerves) inhibits ENS neurons → reducing motility and secretion; also directly constricts blood vessels.',
  'Vagovagal reflex example: Distension of the stomach triggers afferent signals to the brainstem (medulla), which sends efferent vagal signals to relax the stomach wall (receptive relaxation) and increase gastric secretion. Neurotransmitters: ACh, NO, and VIP for muscle relaxation; GRP for gastric acid secretion.',
  'Defecation reflex example: Distension of the rectum sends signals to the spinal cord, triggering parasympathetic efferent signals via the pelvic nerves to relax the internal anal sphincter and enhance colonic motility. ACh stimulates contraction of colonic smooth muscle, while NO and VIP help modulate sphincter relaxation.',
  'Pain reflex example: Strong irritation or distension in the intestines can trigger sympathetic reflexes that inhibit motility and secretion (norepinephrine-mediated) and cause vasoconstriction, leading to conditions like ileus.',

  'Overview of enteroendocrine system: The enteroendocrine cells producing peptide signalling molecules are found singly in the mucosal epithelium. Secretion is controlled by luminal chemical signals, ENS neurons, other enteroendocrine cells, even immune cells. The released molecules can control in a paracrine/endocrine manner directly GIS smooth muscle and glands, but may have also indirect effects through effects on ENS neurons or other enteroendocrine cells. GIS hormones can affect also the CNS (e.g., food intake), and can modulate insulin secretion in the pancreas (incretin effects).',
  'Hormone families: Based on amino acid sequence homology, two most important: gastrins (gastrin, CCK) and secretins (secretin, GIP, GLP-1, VIP). CCK and gastrin receptors use Gq/IP3/DAG; secretin family receptors use the Gs/cAMP pathway.',
  'Gastrin: Cell type: G cells. Location: antrum of the stomach (primary site); duodenum (lesser extent). Function: matching gastric motility and gastric juice secretion to the volume and composition of gastric contents; stimulates gastric acid secretion and gastric mucosal growth. Exists in two forms: G34 (34 amino acids) and G17 (17 amino acids, more abundant). Stimuli for release: presence of peptides and amino acids in the stomach, stomach distension, vagal stimulation via gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP).',
  'Secretin: Cell type: S cells. Location: duodenum (primary site); jejunum (lesser extent). Function: matching gastric emptying, duodenal, bile duct and pancreatic HCO3- secretion to the pH of small intestine content (neutralization of gastric acid); stimulates secretion of bicarbonate from the pancreas; inhibits gastric acid secretion. Stimuli for release: acidic chyme (low pH) in the duodenum.',
  'Cholecystokinin (CCK): Cell type: I cells. Location: duodenum; jejunum. Function: matching gastric emptying, bile release and pancreatic juice enzyme secretion to the quantity and quality of small intestine nutrient (mainly fat and protein) contents; stimulates gallbladder contraction, pancreatic enzyme secretion, relaxation of sphincter of Oddi; inhibits gastric emptying. Stimuli for release: presence of fatty acids, peptides, and amino acids in the duodenum.',
  'Gastric Inhibitory Peptide (GIP) / Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Peptide: Cell type: K cells. Location: duodenum; jejunum. Function: matching gastric emptying and insulin secretion to the carbohydrate contents in the small intestine; stimulates insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells (incretin effect); inhibits gastric acid secretion. Stimuli for release: presence of glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids in the small intestine.',
  'Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1): Cell type: L cells. Location: ileum; colon. Function: stimulates insulin secretion (incretin effect), inhibits glucagon secretion, slows gastric emptying, appetite control, GI motility, GI secretion. Stimuli for release: presence of carbohydrates and fats (luminal chemical stimuli: glucose and fatty acids); also regulated by ENS effects and paracrine stimulation from enteroendocrine K-cells via GIP. The sensation of nutrients is mediated through the same receptor pathways as in the sensation of taste. Hormone secretion requires intracellular Ca2+ signal triggering exocytosis of storage vesicles.',
  'Motilin: Cell type: M cells. Location: duodenum; jejunum. Function: coordination of the cleansing movements of the empty stomach/small intestine in the interdigestive phase (MMC); regulates the migrating motor complex (MMC) during fasting, promoting gastric and intestinal motility. Stimuli for release: periodic release during fasting (every 90-120 minutes); inhibited by food intake.',

Examples: G cells → release gastrin (stimulated by peptides in stomach); I cells → release CCK in response to fats and amino acids; S cells → release secretin in response to acid; L cells → release GLP-1, PYY in response to nutrients in ileum/colon. The sensation of nutrients is mediated through the same receptor pathways as in the sensation of taste; hormone secretion requires intracellular Ca2+ signal triggering exocytosis of storage vesicles.',
