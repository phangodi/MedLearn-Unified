// **LO-1** (Topic-56): The organic solutes reabsorbed with glucose-type reabsorption
officialDefinitions: [
  'Glucose-type reabsorption: the process by which certain solutes, including monosaccharides, amino acids, and ketone bodies, are reabsorbed in the proximal tubule of the nephron. These solutes are freely filtered at the glomerulus and then actively reabsorbed to ensure their retention in the body.',
  'Monosaccharides (glucose, galactose): simple sugars reabsorbed almost completely in the proximal tubule. Transporters: Sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLT1 and SGLT2). SGLT2 located in early proximal tubule (S1 segment), responsible for reabsorbing ~90% of filtered glucose. SGLT1 located in late proximal tubule (S3 segment), reabsorbs remaining ~10%.',
  'Amino acids: freely filtered at the glomerulus and almost completely reabsorbed in the proximal tubule. Mechanism: Sodium-Dependent Amino Acid Transporters. Specific amino acid transporters exist for different groups of amino acids (e.g., neutral, acidic, basic). Transport is secondary active, relying on the sodium gradient created by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump.',
  'Ketone Bodies: produced during periods of fasting, starvation, or uncontrolled diabetes when fat metabolism becomes the primary energy source. Examples: Beta-hydroxybutyrate (predominant ketone body during starvation), Acetoacetate (second major ketone body), Acetone (minor ketone body, largely excreted as a gas or metabolized elsewhere).',
  'Ketone body reabsorption mechanism: Reabsorbed in the proximal tubule via sodium-dependent monocarboxylate transporters (SMCT1 and SMCT2). These transporters use the sodium gradient to reabsorb ketone bodies efficiently.',

// **LO-2** (Topic-56): Renal tubular glucose reabsorption - luminal and basolateral transport mechanisms
officialDefinitions: [
  'Renal tubular glucose reabsorption: occurs primarily in the proximal tubule of the nephron. This process involves luminal membrane transporters (facing the tubular lumen) and basolateral membrane transporters (facing the interstitial fluid and blood). Together, they facilitate the movement of glucose from the filtrate back into the bloodstream.',
  'Luminal Transport Mechanisms: At the luminal membrane, glucose is reabsorbed from the tubular filtrate into the tubular epithelial cells via sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLTs). These transporters use the sodium gradient created by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump to actively transport glucose into the cell.',
  'SGLT2 (Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2): Location: Early proximal tubule (S1 segment). Function: Responsible for ~90% of glucose reabsorption. Mechanism: Couples the movement of 1 Na+ ion with 1 glucose molecule into the cell.',
  'SGLT1 (Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 1): Location: Late proximal tubule (S3 segment). Function: Responsible for the remaining ~10% of glucose reabsorption. Mechanism: Couples the movement of 2 Na+ ions with 1 glucose molecule, making it more effective at low glucose concentrations in the filtrate.',
  'Basolateral Transport Mechanisms: At the basolateral membrane, glucose exits the tubular epithelial cells into the interstitial fluid and subsequently enters the peritubular capillaries. This occurs via facilitated diffusion through glucose transporters.',
  'GLUT2 (Glucose Transporter 2): Location: Early proximal tubule (S1 segment). Function: Transports glucose from the epithelial cell into the interstitial space by facilitated diffusion. Mechanism: GLUT2 operates passively and moves glucose down its concentration gradient.',
  'GLUT1 (Glucose Transporter 1): Location: Late proximal tubule (S3 segment). Function: Facilitates glucose transport into the interstitial space when glucose concentrations are low. Mechanism: Similar to GLUT2, GLUT1 uses facilitated diffusion.',
  'Energy Source: Both SGLT1 and SGLT2 rely on the sodium gradient, which is maintained by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump at the basolateral membrane.',

// **LO-3** (Topic-56): Renal threshold of glucose, Tmax glucose, glucosuria, laboratory tests
officialDefinitions: [
  'Renal threshold for glucose: the plasma glucose concentration at which glucose begins to appear in the urine. This occurs when the glucose transporters in the proximal tubule (SGLT2 and SGLT1) become saturated and can no longer reabsorb all the filtered glucose. Normal Value: ~10 mM (varies between individuals).',
  'Mechanism of renal threshold: Below this threshold, all filtered glucose is reabsorbed by the tubules. Once the threshold is exceeded, excess glucose remains in the filtrate and is excreted in the urine, resulting in glucosuria.',
  'Tubular maximum (Tmax) for glucose: the maximum rate at which glucose can be reabsorbed by the renal tubules. It represents the point where all glucose transporters are saturated. Normal Value: ~375 mg/min in healthy individuals (varies with kidney function and transporter capacity).',
  'Glucosuria: the excretion of glucose in the urine. It occurs when the plasma glucose concentration exceeds the renal threshold or when there is a defect in glucose reabsorption. Causes: Hyperglycemia (seen in diabetes mellitus), Renal Glucosuria (caused by mutations in glucose transporters, e.g., SGLT2).',
  'Laboratory Tests - Dipstick Test (Enzymatic Method): Principle: Uses glucose oxidase and peroxidase enzymes to detect glucose. Glucose oxidase converts glucose to gluconic acid and hydrogen peroxide. Peroxidase reacts with hydrogen peroxide and a chromogen to produce a color change. Procedure: A dipstick impregnated with reagents is dipped in a urine sample, and the color change is compared to a reference chart. Advantages: Quick, inexpensive, and easy to perform. Limitations: Only detects glucose; false negatives may occur with low urine glucose or the presence of ascorbic acid (vitamin C).',
  'Laboratory Tests - Benedict\'s Test (Reducing Substance Test): Principle: Benedict\'s reagent reacts with reducing sugars (e.g., glucose, galactose) to produce a color change from blue to red/orange, depending on the glucose concentration. Procedure: Urine is mixed with Benedict\'s reagent and heated. Advantages: Can detect glucose and other reducing sugars. Limitations: Non-specific (e.g., detects lactose, galactose, and fructose, not just glucose).',

officialDefinitions: [
  'Osmotic diuresis: a condition in which excessive solutes (e.g., glucose) in the renal tubules impair water reabsorption, leading to increased urine production. In diabetes mellitus, when blood glucose levels exceed the renal threshold, glucosuria (glucose in the urine) occurs, triggering osmotic diuresis.',
  'Excessive Glucose Filtration at the Glomerulus: In diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia causes plasma glucose concentrations to exceed the renal threshold (10-12 mM). As a result, a large amount of glucose is filtered into the nephron.',
  'Saturation of Glucose Reabsorption: The glucose transporters in the proximal tubule (SGLT2 and SGLT1) have a limited capacity to reabsorb glucose, defined as the tubular maximum (Tmax) (~375 mg/min). When the filtered glucose exceeds Tmax, the excess glucose remains in the tubular fluid, resulting in glucosuria.',
  'Impairment of Water Reabsorption: Glucose in the tubular lumen acts as an osmotic agent, increasing the tubular fluid\'s osmolarity. The increased osmolarity reduces water reabsorption in the proximal tubule and the descending limb of the loop of Henle, where water reabsorption occurs passively.',
  'Increased Urine Volume: The presence of unreabsorbed glucose in the distal nephron further reduces water reabsorption in the collecting ducts, resulting in large volumes of dilute urine.',

// **LO-5** (Topic-56): Fate of filtered peptides and proteins, proteinuria, laboratory tests
officialDefinitions: [
  'Fate of Filtered Peptides and Proteins: Small amounts of peptides and proteins are filtered at the glomerulus due to their small size or specific characteristics. The proximal tubule plays a crucial role in reabsorbing these proteins and preventing their loss in urine.',
  'Filtration at the Glomerulus: The glomerular filtration barrier allows the passage of small proteins and peptides (e.g., albumin in trace amounts, insulin, and other small peptides) while restricting larger molecules (e.g., immunoglobulins). Under normal conditions, only small quantities of proteins (10–20 mg/day) are filtered into the tubules.',
  'Reabsorption of Low Molecular Weight Proteins: These proteins (e.g., insulin, β2-microglobulin) are reabsorbed via endocytosis. Specialized megalin-cubilin receptor complexes bind filtered proteins, facilitating their uptake into proximal tubule cells.',
  'Peptide handling: Peptides (e.g., angiotensin, bradykinin) are degraded by brush border enzymes into amino acids, which are then reabsorbed. Proteins internalized by endocytosis are degraded into amino acids in lysosomes. The amino acids are then transported across the basolateral membrane into the bloodstream.',
  'Proteinuria: the presence of abnormal amounts of protein in the urine, exceeding the normal range of <150 mg/day. It indicates a defect in the glomerular filtration barrier, tubular reabsorption, or excessive protein load. Commonly due to: Glomerular damage (e.g. in nephrotic syndrome), Tubular dysfunction, Overflow of low molecular weight proteins (e.g. in multiple myeloma).',
  'Laboratory Tests - Dipstick Test: Principle: The test uses a pH-sensitive dye that changes color in the presence of albumin. Procedure: A dipstick is immersed in a urine sample, and the color change is compared to a reference chart. Advantages: Quick, inexpensive, and easy to use. Limitations: Primarily detects albumin and may miss other proteins (e.g., globulins, Bence-Jones proteins).',
  'Laboratory Tests - Sulfosalicylic Acid (SSA) Test: Principle: Proteins precipitate when mixed with sulfosalicylic acid. Procedure: A urine sample is treated with SSA, and turbidity indicates the presence of protein. Advantages: Detects all types of proteins, including light chains. Limitations: Semi-quantitative and requires manual interpretation.',
  'Laboratory Tests - Boiling Test (Heat Test): Principle: Proteins coagulate (denature) when heated. Procedure: Heat the upper part of the urine sample in a test tube. If cloudiness or precipitate forms, it may indicate proteins. Note: Must rule out phosphates — add acetic acid; if the cloudiness persists, it\'s protein.',

  'Uptake Across the Basolateral Membrane: Organic anions are transported from the peritubular capillaries into the proximal tubular cells via secondary active transport, which relies on the sodium gradient. Transporter: Organic Anion Transporter 1 and 3 (OAT1 and OAT3).',
  'Mechanism of basolateral uptake: Sodium-Potassium ATPase creates a sodium gradient by actively extruding sodium out of the tubular cell. The sodium gradient powers the sodium-dicarboxylate co-transporter (NaDC), which imports alpha-ketoglutarate into the tubular cell. The high intracellular alpha-ketoglutarate drives the exchange of alpha-ketoglutarate for organic anions (e.g., PAH, urate) via OAT1 and OAT3.',
  'Efflux Across the Luminal Membrane: Once inside the tubular cell, organic anions are secreted into the tubular lumen (urine) via active transport.

  'Reabsorption in the Proximal Tubule: ~90% of the filtered uric acid is reabsorbed in the early proximal tubule via specific transporters on the luminal membrane. URAT1 (Urate Transporter 1): A major transporter responsible for uric acid reabsorption.

OAT4 (Organic Anion Transporter 4): Another transporter involved in reabsorbing uric acid by exchanging it for intracellular dicarboxylates.',
  'Secretion in the Proximal Tubule: Approximately 50% of the reabsorbed uric acid is secreted back into the tubular lumen in the late proximal tubule. OAT1 and OAT3 (Organic Anion Transporters 1 and 3): Located on the basolateral membrane, these transporters mediate the uptake of uric acid from the blood into the tubular cells.

officialDefinitions: [
  'Urea: a small, nitrogen-containing molecule produced in the liver as the end product of protein metabolism. It plays a significant role in maintaining the osmotic gradient in the kidney, which is crucial for water reabsorption and urine concentration.',
  'Urea Reabsorption in the Proximal Tubule: Urea is freely filtered at the glomerulus, so its concentration in the filtrate is equal to that in plasma. Approximately 50% of the filtered urea is passively reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.',
  'Mechanism of proximal urea reabsorption: Urea reabsorption occurs passively, driven by the concentration gradient created as water is reabsorbed. As sodium, chloride, and water are reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, the tubular fluid becomes concentrated, resulting in a higher urea concentration in the tubular lumen compared to the interstitium. This concentration gradient allows urea to diffuse across the epithelial cells into the interstitial fluid. Clinical Note: The proximal tubule does not have specific urea transporters; instead, reabsorption is purely diffusion-dependent.',
  'Thin Descending and Ascending Limbs of the Loop of Henle - Secretion of Urea: Urea is secreted into the tubular fluid in the thin limbs of the loop of Henle, particularly in the inner medulla. Urea diffuses from the medullary interstitium (where urea concentration is high) into the tubular lumen. This process increases the urea concentration in the tubular fluid.',
  'Distal Convoluted Tubule and Cortical Collecting Duct: These segments are relatively impermeable to urea, so its concentration in the tubular fluid increases as water is reabsorbed.',
  'Medullary Collecting Duct - Reabsorption of Urea: In the inner medullary collecting duct, urea transporters (UT-A1 and UT-A3) facilitate the reabsorption of urea. Urea moves from the tubular lumen into the medullary interstitium, where it contributes to the hyperosmolar environment required for water reabsorption.',
  'Urea Recirculation: The reabsorbed urea enters the medullary interstitium and can be secreted back into the loop of Henle. This urea recycling ensures that urea remains concentrated in the medullary interstitium, enhancing the osmotic gradient required for water reabsorption in the descending loop of Henle and the collecting ducts. Urea contributes to ~50% of the medullary osmolarity in the inner medulla (~600 mOsm/L out of 1200 mOsm/L).',
