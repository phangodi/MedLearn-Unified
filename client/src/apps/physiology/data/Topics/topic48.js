        'Origin: The sympathetic vasomotor tone originates from the vasomotor center, located in the medulla oblongata of the brainstem. This center integrates inputs from higher brain centers (e.g., hypothalamus, cortex), baroreceptors, and chemoreceptors. It continuously generates tonic efferent signals to maintain a baseline level of vascular tone. The origin of the sympathetic tone resides in the medulla.',

        'Neurotransmitter: Norepinephrine (NE) is the primary neurotransmitter released from postganglionic sympathetic nerve terminals. In some vessels, the adrenal medulla releases epinephrine, contributing to vascular tone regulation.',
        'Receptor: Alpha-1 adrenergic receptors are the primary receptors mediating vasoconstriction. Found on vascular smooth muscle cells of arterioles and veins. Mechanism: Norepinephrine binds to alpha-1 receptors. This activates the Gq protein pathway, leading to increased intracellular calcium via the phospholipase C (PLC) pathway. Smooth muscle contraction and vasoconstriction.',
        'Physiological significance: Sympathetic vasomotor tone ensures a minimum level of systemic vascular resistance, maintaining blood pressure under resting conditions. It adapts to changing physiological demands, such as during exercise, stress, or blood loss. It allows the redistribution of blood flow to meet the metabolic demands of different organs under resting and stress conditions, such as exercise, hemorrhage, or thermoregulation.',
        'Organ circulations where sympathetic vasomotor tone is significant: Skin (critical for thermoregulation, sympathetic tone causes vasoconstriction in cold conditions to conserve heat and vasodilation in heat for cooling, vasoconstriction during stress helps redirect blood flow to vital organs). Skeletal muscle (maintains vascular resistance during rest and directs blood flow during exercise, rest: sympathetic tone keeps skeletal muscle arterioles constricted, maintaining systemic vascular resistance, exercise: local metabolic factors override sympathetic tone, increasing blood flow). Splanchnic circulation (gastrointestinal and liver, acts as a reservoir for blood redistribution during stress or hemorrhage, sympathetic stimulation causes intense vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow to the GI tract and liver while increasing it to skeletal muscle and the heart).',
        'Organ circulations where sympathetic vasomotor tone is negligible: Coronary circulation (coronary blood flow is primarily regulated by local metabolic factors such as oxygen demand and adenosine, sympathetic stimulation has minimal vasoconstrictor effects on coronary vessels due to local metabolic autoregulation overriding sympathetic tone). Brain (cerebral blood flow is tightly regulated by metabolic needs such as CO₂ levels and pH rather than sympathetic tone, excessive vasoconstriction would impair brain perfusion, so sympathetic influence on cerebral circulation is negligible). Kidney (autoregulation predominates in maintaining renal perfusion and glomerular filtration rate over a wide range of blood pressures, sympathetic tone is significant only during severe stress or hemorrhage, where it reduces renal blood flow to conserve blood volume).'

Arteriolar vasoconstriction increases total peripheral resistance maintaining arterial pressure, and venoconstriction reduces venous pooling and increases venous return. Parasympathetic activity is simultaneously reduced. When lying down, the horizontal position eliminates gravitational pooling and venous return increases, resulting in a transient rise in cardiac output and blood pressure. Increased baroreceptor firing suppresses the sympathetic nervous system and activates the parasympathetic nervous system, decreasing heart rate and cardiac output, causing arteriolar vasodilation to reduce total peripheral resistance, and reducing venous return. This homeostatic regulation maintains relatively constant mean arterial pressure despite postural changes.'

        'Peripheral chemoreceptors: Location: Carotid bodies (at the bifurcation of the carotid arteries) and aortic bodies (near the aortic arch). Stimuli: Hypoxia (low PO₂), hypercapnia (high PCO₂), and acidosis (low pH). Afferent pathways: Signals are transmitted via the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX) and vagus nerve (cranial nerve X) to the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) in the medulla.',
        'Central chemoreceptors: Location: Medulla oblongata, near the respiratory centers. Stimuli: Primarily sensitive to hypercapnia (high CO₂) and resulting acidosis in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Mechanism: Increased PCO₂ leads to the formation of carbonic acid, lowering CSF pH and stimulating chemoreceptors.',
        'Hypoxia-induced reflexes: Goal: Increase oxygen delivery to tissues. Cardiovascular effects: Heart: Increased heart rate (tachycardia), mediated by sympathetic activation. Arterioles: Peripheral vasoconstriction (except in the brain and heart) to shunt blood toward vital organs. Respiration: Increased respiratory rate and depth (hyperventilation) to improve oxygen uptake.',
        'Hypercapnia-induced reflexes: Goal: Increase CO₂ elimination and oxygen delivery. Cardiovascular effects: Increased sympathetic activity → Vasoconstriction in non-vital areas. Modest tachycardia to increase cardiac output. Respiratory effects: Hyperventilation to eliminate CO₂ and restore pH balance.',
        'Major function of chemoreceptor reflexes: The major function of these reflexes is the stimulation of breathing. Only very severe hypotension (below 60-80 mmHg) results in hypoxia/hypercapnia that is capable of eliciting significant vasoconstriction through chemoreceptors.',

        'Stimulus for Cushing reflex: Increased ICP compresses cerebral blood vessels, leading to cerebral ischemia (reduced blood flow). Trigger: Hypoxia and hypercapnia in the medulla, caused by reduced cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP). CPP = Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) - Intracranial Pressure (ICP). If ICP approaches MAP, cerebral perfusion ceases.',
        'Activation mechanism: Severe ischemia and hypercapnia stimulate central chemoreceptors and medullary neurons, activating the sympathetic nervous system.',
        'Cardiovascular effects of Cushing reflex: Systemic vasoconstriction: Generalized arteriolar constriction raises MAP to maintain cerebral blood flow despite high ICP. Bradycardia: The baroreceptor reflex is activated by the rise in MAP, causing increased vagal stimulation to slow the heart rate. Respiratory irregularities: Medullary ischemia disrupts normal respiratory rhythm, causing irregular breathing patterns (Cheyne-Stokes respiration or apnea).',
        'Stages of Cushing reflex: Initial compensation: Increased sympathetic activity temporarily restores CPP. Progressive ICP rise: Further compression of brain structures reduces perfusion and oxygenation. Failure of compensation: If ICP exceeds MAP, perfusion ceases, leading to brainstem herniation and death.'
