  'Cardiac cycle duration: the flow of blood in and out of the heart takes an average of 0.8 seconds performed in 4 phases.',
  'Systole (0.27 sec): includes isovolumetric contraction, maximal (rapid) ejection, and decreased ejection.',
  'Diastole (0.53 sec): includes isovolumetric relaxation, rapid filling, slow filling, and atrial contraction.',
  'Atrial Contraction (End of Diastole): at the end of diastole, the atria contract (systole) to push the remaining blood into the ventricles. This occurs after the passive filling phase and accounts for about 20-30% of the total ventricular filling, known as the "atrial kick". The P wave on the electrocardiogram (ECG) represents atrial depolarization, which precedes atrial contraction. The atrioventricular (AV) valves (mitral and tricuspid) remain open, allowing blood to flow into the ventricles.',
  'Isovolumetric Contraction (Start of Systole): after the atria contract and ventricular filling is complete, the ventricles begin to contract. The pressure within the ventricles rises rapidly, but the volume remains constant as the aortic and pulmonary valves are still closed. This phase starts after the QRS complex on the ECG, which represents ventricular depolarization. The AV valves close, causing the first heart sound (S1), but the semilunar valves (aortic and pulmonary) remain closed.',
  'Maximal (Rapid) Ejection (Systole): when the pressure in the ventricles exceeds the pressure in the aorta and pulmonary arteries, the aortic and pulmonary valves open, allowing blood to be rapidly ejected into the circulation. The aortic and pulmonary valves are open; the AV valves remain closed.',
  'Decreased Ejection (Systole): as the ventricles begin to repolarize, the force of contraction decreases, and the rate of blood ejection slows. Ventricular pressure starts to fall, though blood continues to flow due to inertia. The aortic and pulmonary valves remain open initially but prepare to close as pressure falls.',
  'Isovolumetric Relaxation (Start of Diastole): the ventricles relax after repolarization, leading to a rapid decrease in pressure. The semilunar valves close due to the higher pressure in the aorta and pulmonary arteries, producing the second heart sound (S2). The volume in the ventricles remains constant as all valves are closed. The semilunar valves close (S2 sound), and the AV valves remain closed until the pressure in the ventricles drops below the atrial pressure.',
  'Rapid Filling (Early Diastole): when ventricular pressure drops below atrial pressure, the AV valves open, and blood rapidly flows from the atria into the ventricles due to the pressure gradient. The AV valves open (mitral and tricuspid); the semilunar valves remain closed. Accounts for the majority of ventricular filling and occurs passively without atrial contraction. 75-80 % of the blood volume flows directly through the atria into the ventricles.',
  'Slow Filling (Diastasis) (Diastole): this phase is a period of reduced ventricular filling as the pressure between the atria and ventricles begins to equalize. It is the longest phase of the cardiac cycle. The AV valves remain open; the semilunar valves are closed.'

  'Factors contributing to cardiac sounds: Valve Closure: the primary contributor to both S1 and S2 is the closure of the heart valves, causing abrupt changes in blood flow and vibrations within the heart. Tension of Chordae Tendineae: the tensing of these fibrous cords during valve closure helps generate the sounds. Elastic Properties of the Valves: the elasticity and rapid recoil of the valves contribute to the generation and quality of the sound. Blood Flow Dynamics: the deceleration of blood flow during valve closure and the subsequent vibrations contribute to the sound\'s propagation. Surrounding Cardiac Structures: the myocardium and other nearby tissues play a role in transmitting and modulating the heart sounds.',
  '1st Heart Sound (S1): Timing: The S1 sound occurs at the onset of ventricular systole, marking the beginning of the contraction phase. Causes: S1 is produced by the closure of the atrioventricular (AV) valves, which include the mitral and tricuspid valves. The sound is primarily due to the vibrations generated when these valves close and the sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae and the ventricular myocardium. Location: S1 is best heard at the apex of the heart, typically in the 5th intercostal space at the midclavicular line. Characteristics: S1 is typically described as a low-pitched, "lub" sound.',
  '2nd Heart Sound (S2): Timing: The S2 sound occurs at the onset of ventricular diastole, indicating the beginning of the relaxation phase and the end of systole. Causes: S2 is generated by the closure of the semilunar valves, which include the aortic and pulmonary valves. This sound is associated with the sudden halt of blood flow and the recoil of the blood columns in the aorta and pulmonary artery. Location: S2 is best heard at the base of the heart, typically at the 2nd intercostal space, with the aortic component (A2) louder at the right sternal border and the pulmonary component (P2) heard best at the left sternal border. Characteristics: S2 is higher-pitched and shorter than S1 and is often described as a "dub" sound.',
  'Aorta valve: 2R2. Pulmonary valve: 2L2. Tricuspidal valve: 4-5R1. Mitral valve: 5L6-8.',
  '1. (systolic) sound: contraction, valves, ejection of blood. 2. (diastolic) sound: valves, can be split. 3. (diastolic) sound: cuspidal valves during rapid filling. 4. (late diastolic) sound: atrial contraction.'

  'Push-Pull Characteristic of the Cardiac Pump: Push Phase (Systole): During systole, the ventricles contract, pushing blood out into the arteries. This phase involves the ejection of blood from the left ventricle into the aorta and from the right ventricle into the pulmonary artery. Pull Phase (Diastole): During diastole, as the ventricles relax, the heart\'s structure, including the atria, creates a negative pressure that assists in pulling blood from the veins into the atria. This passive filling ensures that blood is effectively pulled into the chambers, preparing for the next cycle. Overall Role: This push-pull characteristic ensures that while blood is being expelled from the ventricles during contraction, blood is simultaneously being drawn into the atria, preparing for subsequent filling and pumping cycles. It contributes to the heart\'s ability to maintain a continuous flow of blood without interruption.',
  'Valve-Plane Mechanism: Description: The valve-plane mechanism refers to the dynamic movement of the heart\'s valvular plane (the plane where the atrioventricular valves, including the tricuspid and mitral valves, are located) during the cardiac cycle. Mechanics During Systole: As the ventricles contract during systole, the valve plane moves downward toward the apex of the heart. This downward movement creates a negative pressure in the atria, enhancing venous return by drawing blood from the veins into the atria. Mechanics During Diastole: When the ventricles relax during diastole, the valve plane moves upward. This movement aids in filling the ventricles as it increases the atrial pressure, which propels blood into the ventricles. Importance: The valve-plane movement ensures that the heart operates as an efficient pump by facilitating proper filling during diastole and effective ejection during systole. It enhances the efficiency of the heart by making optimal use of the natural pressure changes during the cardiac cycle.'

  'Right atrial pressure changes during cardiac cycle: Fluctuations in the right atrial pressure cause pressure oscillations in the jugular vein. Physiologically only visible during increased venous pressure (weight lifting, Valsalva manouvre).',
  'a-wave (Atrial contraction): The a-wave occurs during atrial systole when the right atrium contracts to push blood into the right ventricle. This contraction leads to an increase in right atrial pressure, which is reflected in the jugular veins as the a-wave. This phase correlates with the end of ventricular diastole. A, a positive wave due to contraction of the right atrium.',
  'x-descent (Atrial relaxation): This initial x-descent occurs after the a-wave and represents the relaxation of the atrium as it completes contraction, leading to a drop in right atrial pressure. Following the c-wave, there is a drop in right atrial pressure known as the x-descent. This phase occurs as the atrium relaxes and the tricuspid valve moves downward due to ventricular contraction. This pressure drop is visible as a downward deflection in the jugular pulse. X, a negative deflection due to atrial relaxation during the ventricular systole.',
  'c-wave (Tricuspid valve bulging): The c-wave is observed during early ventricular systole, specifically during isovolumetric contraction. As the right ventricle contracts, the tricuspid valve bulges slightly back into the right atrium, causing a temporary rise in atrial pressure. This results in a small wave in the jugular pulse. C, a positive deflection due to bulging of the tricuspid valve toward the atria at the onset of ventricular contraction.',
  'v-wave (Atrial filling): The v-wave is formed as the right atrium fills with blood from the superior and inferior vena cavae during late ventricular systole. The tricuspid valve remains closed during this phase, causing a gradual increase in right atrial pressure. This phase results in an upward slope in the jugular pulse. V, a positive deflection due to filling of the right atrium against the closed tricuspid valve during ventricular contraction.',
  'y-descent (Ventricular filling): The y-descent follows the v-wave and occurs when the tricuspid valve opens at the beginning of ventricular diastole, allowing blood to flow from the right atrium into the right ventricle. This leads to a rapid decrease in right atrial pressure, which is reflected as a downward deflection in the jugular pulse. Y, a negative deflection due to emptying of the right atrium upon ventricular relaxation.',
  'Jugular pulse waveform: the pressure changes in the right atrium are transmitted through the venous system and can be observed as the jugular venous pulse. The jugular pulse waveform consists of: a-wave: A visible peak corresponding to atrial contraction. c-wave: A smaller, less pronounced peak due to the bulging of the tricuspid valve. x-descent: A downward deflection representing atrial relaxation and the downward movement of the tricuspid valve. v-wave: An upward slope caused by the filling of the right atrium. y-descent: A sharp downward deflection as blood flows into the right ventricle.'
