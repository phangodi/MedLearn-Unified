        'Upper urinary tract: consists of the renal pelvis, calyces, and ureters. Plays a crucial role in the transportation of urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Motor functions are primarily driven by peristaltic movements and involve the coordination of smooth muscle activity, neural regulation, and specialized structures.',
        'Urine flow from renal pelvis to bladder: Urine formed in the nephrons enters the minor calyces, flows into the major calyces, and then into the renal pelvis, which acts as a reservoir before urine is transported through the ureters to the bladder. This flow is facilitated by rhythmic peristaltic contractions of the smooth muscle.',
        'Pacemaker activity in renal pelvis and calyces: Specialized smooth muscle cells in the renal pelvis generate spontaneous action potentials, initiating rhythmic contractions. These pacemaker cells are located near the pelvi-ureteric junction. The action potentials spread to adjacent smooth muscle cells via gap junctions, coordinating contractions. Contractions propagate distally, moving urine into the ureters.',
        'Ureteral peristalsis: Ureteral smooth muscle exhibits intrinsic peristaltic waves, which propel urine toward the bladder. The peristalsis is unidirectional, preventing backflow of urine. Longitudinal and circular smooth muscle layers in the ureter wall alternately contract and relax to produce peristalsis. Longitudinal muscle shortens the ureteral segment. Circular muscle propels urine distally by constricting the lumen. Peristaltic waves occur at a frequency of 1-5 contractions per minute, depending on urine flow and hydration status.',
        'Neural control of upper urinary tract: Sympathetic nervous system inhibits peristalsis and reduces urine flow by relaxing the ureteral smooth muscle, mediated via α-adrenergic receptors. Parasympathetic nervous system enhances peristalsis by stimulating smooth muscle contraction, mediated via muscarinic receptors (primarily M2 and M3 receptors).',

During bladder filling or contraction, increased bladder pressure compresses the ureteral openings, preventing urine reflux.'
