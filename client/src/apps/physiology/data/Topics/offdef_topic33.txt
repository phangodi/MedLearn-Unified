  'Flow: the fluid volume flowing through the cross-section of the tube in a given time period (V/t). Designated as Q, unit of measurement volume/time (eg liter/min). When applied for the whole circulation: the cardiac output (CO).',
  'Flow velocity (v): describes the average linear velocity of the fluid particles (m/s). Attention! flow ≠ flow velocity (v), the latter describes the average linear velocity of the fluid particles (m/s).',
  'Mathematical relationship: Q=A∙v, where A is the cross sectional area of the vessel.',
  'Units: Flow commonly measured in m³/s (SI unit for flow) or L/min (often used in physiology for cardiac output). Velocity measured in m/s (SI unit for velocity) or cm/s (often used in clinical settings).',
  'Continuity equation: (Q= v. A) ensures that the total flow (Q) remains constant throughout a closed system (e.g., the circulatory system). Implications: Narrower vessels (smaller A): Higher velocity. Wider vessels (larger A): Lower velocity. Capillaries: Massive total cross-sectional area leads to slower blood velocity, facilitating exchange.',
  'Cross-sectional area (cm²): Aorta (~5.3 cm²), arteries (20 cm²), capillaries (3500 cm²), veins (100 cm²), vena cavae (10 cm²). Flow velocity (cm/sec): Arteries (18 cm/sec → 5 cm/sec) → capillaries (0.02-0.1 cm/sec). E.g., aorta: (if CO = 5.6 L/min) v = 5600 cm³/min / 5.3 cm² = 93.3 cm³/sec / 5.3 cm² = 17.6 cm/sec.',
  'Physiological relevance: Flow velocity is inversely proportional to cross-sectional area: v = Q / A. Blood velocity varies significantly depending on the type of vessel: Aorta: High velocity (~20-30 cm/s) due to the small cross-sectional area. Capillaries: Low velocity (~0.1 cm/s) due to the large total cross-sectional area of all capillaries combined. Slow velocity in capillaries allows for effective nutrient and gas exchange.'

For a steady state: Any change in flow in one circuit (e.g., due to heart failure) will affect the other circuit because they are serially connected.',
  'Systemic circulation: Function: Delivers oxygenated blood to body tissues and returns deoxygenated blood to the heart. Pathway: Oxygenated blood exits the left ventricle through the aorta. Blood travels through arteries, capillaries, and veins. Deoxygenated blood returns to the right atrium via the superior and inferior vena cava. Pressure and Resistance: Operates under high pressure to pump blood over long distances. Resistance is high due to narrow and long vessels.',
  'Pulmonary circulation: Function: Transports deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation and returns oxygenated blood to the heart. Pathway: Deoxygenated blood exits the right ventricle via the pulmonary arteries. Blood travels to the lungs for gas exchange. Oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. Pressure and Resistance: Operates under low pressure because blood travels a short distance. Resistance is low due to short and wide vessels.',

  'Conductance (C): Conductance is the ease with which blood flows through a vessel, the reciprocal of resistance: C = 1/R. A larger vessel diameter increases conductance significantly. Units: L/min·mmHg.',
  'Resistance in series: When resistances are added in series, they are connected end-to-end, so blood flows sequentially through each resistance. Total resistance (R) is the sum of individual resistances: Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3 + ... Key Effects: Total resistance increases. Flow (Q) decreases because total resistance is higher for a given pressure gradient: Q = ΔP / Rtotal. Physiological Example: Blood flow through arteries, arterioles, and capillaries in the systemic circulation.',
  'Resistance in parallel: When resistances are added in parallel, blood flow splits into multiple pathways, and the total resistance is reduced. Total resistance (R) is calculated using: 1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ... Key Effects: Total resistance decreases because the overall system offers more pathways for flow.

  'Effects of changing parameters on flow: Doubling pressure doubles flow. Doubling length halves flow. Doubling radius increases flow 16-fold (2⁴). Doubling viscosity halves flow.',
  'Deviations from Hagen–Poiseuille\\'s law in the circulatory system: Hagen–Poiseuille\\'s law provides a theoretical framework for fluid flow in rigid, cylindrical tubes with steady, laminar flow. However, the circulatory system has unique characteristics that lead to significant deviations from these assumptions.',
  'Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid: Assumption: Hagen–Poiseuille\\'s law assumes the fluid has a constant viscosity (Newtonian fluid). Reality: Blood is a non-Newtonian fluid, meaning its viscosity changes depending on flow conditions (shear rate). At low shear rates (e.g., in capillaries or veins), red blood cells tend to aggregate, increasing blood viscosity. At high shear rates (e.g., in large arteries), red blood cells align with flow, reducing viscosity (shear thinning).',
  'Pulsatile flow: Assumption: The law assumes steady, laminar flow. Reality: Blood flow in the circulatory system is pulsatile, reflecting the rhythmic contractions of the heart. The pulsatile nature creates variations in pressure and flow velocity during systole and diastole. Pulsatility leads to complex pressure-flow relationships not accounted for in Hagen–Poiseuille\\'s model.',
  'Vessel elasticity: Assumption: Hagen–Poiseuille\\'s law assumes vessels are rigid tubes. Reality: Blood vessels, especially arteries, are elastic and can expand or contract depending on pressure. Elasticity allows arteries to store energy during systole (compliance) and release it during diastole, maintaining blood flow.',
  'Branching and geometry of blood vessels: Assumption: The law assumes straight, cylindrical tubes of uniform diameter. Reality: The circulatory system is highly branched, with vessels of varying diameters. Vessel branching changes flow patterns, leading to localized turbulence and increased resistance, especially at bifurcations.',
  'Turbulence: Assumption: Hagen–Poiseuille\\'s law assumes laminar flow. Reality: While laminar flow predominates in smaller vessels, turbulence can occur in larger vessels (e.g., the aorta) at high flow velocities or during systole. Turbulence increases resistance, which is not predicted by the law.',
  'Distribution of resistance: Assumption: Resistance is uniform along the vessel. Reality: In the circulatory system, resistance is unevenly distributed. The highest resistance occurs in the arterioles, which act as the primary site for regulating blood flow.',
  'Summary of criteria: Cylindrical, rigid, tubes, no branches vs. Elastic, branching vessels, veins are not cylindrical. Newtonian fluid vs. non-newtonian fluid, the blood. Constant flow vs. Pulsatile flow (arteries). Laminar flow vs. Sometimes turbulent flow. The equation thus cannot be possibly true for the circulation, however, the law identifies all the important factors.'

  'Laminar flow: Smooth, orderly, and layered flow of a fluid, where each layer moves parallel to the next without mixing. Characteristics: Flow velocity is highest at the center of the vessel and decreases toward the vessel wall (parabolic velocity profile). Quiet and energy-efficient. Typically occurs in small-diameter vessels and under low flow rates. Examples in Circulation: Normal flow through arteries and veins under physiologic conditions.',
  'Laminar blood flow characteristics: Fluid sheets (laminae) gliding over each other. In tubes the sheets can be considered as concentric circles, the linear velocity of the flowing molecules decreases from center to periphery. A parabola-shaped velocity gradient profile develops.',
  'Turbulent flow: Chaotic, disordered fluid motion with mixing between layers, creating eddies and vortices. Characteristics: Increased energy loss due to chaotic motion. Associated with vibrations that can generate sounds. Occurs when flow velocity is high, vessel geometry is irregular, or blood viscosity is low. Examples in Circulation: Flow at sites of arterial stenosis, valve defects, or bifurcations.',
  'Turbulent flow definition: Irregular flow with whirlpools always presents as increased viscosity increasing resistance. Turbulent flow is promoted by wide tubing, tube irregularities (branching, curving, partial occlusion), high flow velocity, and low viscosity.',
  'Factors that shift laminar flow to turbulent flow: Increased Flow Velocity: High velocities (e.g., in stenotic arteries) disrupt smooth, laminar flow. Large Vessel Diameter: Wider vessels decrease the influence of viscous forces, making turbulence more likely. Decreased Blood Viscosity: Conditions like anemia reduce blood viscosity, increasing the tendency for turbulence. Irregular Vessel Geometry: Plaques, bifurcations, or abnormal narrowing disrupt flow patterns. High Pressure Gradients: Steep pressure differences (e.g., across stenotic valves) accelerate flow, promoting turbulence. Branching and Curvature: Flow through curved or branching vessels can induce instability.',

Thresholds: Re < 2000: Laminar flow. Re > 3000: Turbulent flow. Between 2000 and 3000: Transitional flow, where instability begins.

Diastolic murmurs: Occur during ventricular relaxation (e.g., mitral stenosis, aortic regurgitation).',
  'Bruits: Result from turbulent blood flow in arteries, commonly due to narrowing or atherosclerotic plaques. Heard over carotid arteries, femoral arteries, or other large vessels.',
  'Clinical relevance: The presence of murmurs or bruits is a key diagnostic indicator of cardiovascular abnormalities, such as: Valvular heart disease (e.g., stenosis, regurgitation). Arterial stenosis (e.g., carotid artery stenosis). High-output states (e.g., anemia or hyperthyroidism). The intensity and quality of these sounds provide information about the severity of the underlying condition.',
