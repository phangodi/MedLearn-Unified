  'External work of the heart: the mechanical energy expended by the heart to pump blood. This energy is derived from myocardial contraction and is classified into two main components: pressure-volume (PV) work and kinetic work.',
  'Pressure-Volume (PV) Work: PV work is the energy used by the heart to generate pressure to move blood from the ventricles into the arterial system. During systole, the ventricles contract and eject blood into the aorta and pulmonary artery. This work is proportional to the pressure developed by the ventricles and the volume of blood ejected (stroke volume). PV work constitutes the majority of the heart\'s external work (~99%).',
  'Kinetic Work: the energy used to impart velocity to the ejected blood. Blood must accelerate as it exits the ventricles into the arteries. Kinetic work is proportional to the velocity and mass of the blood. Kinetic work is a small fraction of the heart\'s total external work (~1%), but it becomes significant in conditions with high cardiac output or valve disorders (e.g., aortic stenosis).',
  'Mechanical Efficiency of Cardiac Work: the ratio of the external work performed by the heart to the total energy expenditure of the myocardium. External Work: Sum of PV work and kinetic work. Total Energy Expenditure: Includes both external work and the energy lost as heat (e.g., due to basal metabolic processes and internal myocardial work).',
  'Normal Efficiency: In a healthy heart, mechanical efficiency is about 20–25%. Most of the energy (~75–80%) is dissipated as heat to maintain myocardial contraction and cellular processes.',
  'Factors Affecting Mechanical Efficiency: Increased Afterload: Higher pressure in the arteries (e.g., in hypertension) increases PV work, reducing efficiency. Heart Rate: Excessively high heart rates reduce diastolic filling time, increasing energy expenditure without proportional increases in output. Valvular Disorders: Conditions like aortic stenosis increase kinetic work, further reducing efficiency. Heart Failure: Ineffective contractions increase energy expenditure without significant external work.'

  'Cardiac muscle fibers: have a high and continuous demand for energy, primarily for maintaining contractile function and ion gradients. To meet this demand, the heart is highly aerobic and contains abundant mitochondria, occupying ~30% of the cell volume, allowing for efficient oxidative phosphorylation.',
  'Substrate Utilization in Cardiac Muscle: Cardiac muscle is metabolically flexible and can use multiple substrates depending on availability, oxygen supply, and physiological state.',
  'Fatty acids (~60–80%): The primary energy source under resting and fasting conditions. β-oxidation of fatty acids provides acetyl-CoA for the TCA cycle.',
  'Glucose (~10–30%): Utilized more during increased workload or hypoxia (e.g., exercise or ischemia). Enters via GLUT1 and insulin-regulated GLUT4 transporters.',
  'Lactate (~10–20%): Produced by skeletal muscles and taken up by the heart, especially during exercise. Converted to pyruvate and used in the TCA cycle.',
  'Ketone bodies (variable): Usage increases during fasting, diabetes, or heart failure. β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate are oxidized in mitochondria.',
  'Amino acids (minor role): Branched-chain amino acids may contribute modestly during catabolic states.',
  'Oxygen Consumption of the Heart at Rest: At rest, the human heart accounts for approximately 4-5% of the total resting oxygen consumption, despite comprising only about 0.5% of total body mass. This reflects the high oxidative metabolism required for continuous activity. Cardiac oxygen consumption at rest: ~8–10 ml O₂/min in an average adult (about 250 ml/min total body O₂ use). Oxygen extraction from coronary blood is already high at rest (~70–80%), so increases in oxygen demand are met mainly by increasing coronary blood flow.'

  'Phasic Flow of Blood to the Ventricular Myocardium Through the Cardiac Cycle: Coronary blood flow to the ventricular myocardium, especially the left ventricle, is phasic, meaning it varies throughout the cardiac cycle. This variation occurs because the myocardium exerts pressure on the coronary vessels, compressing them during systole and relaxing during diastole. The flow pattern differs significantly between the left and right ventricles due to differences in intraventricular pressure.',
  'Isovolumetric Contraction (Early Systole): The ventricles begin to contract, but the aortic and pulmonary valves remain closed. Intraventricular pressure rises sharply, compressing the coronary vessels, particularly in the left ventricle. Blood Flow in Left Ventricle: Blood flow is significantly reduced or may cease entirely due to high compression of intramyocardial vessels, especially in the subendocardium. Blood Flow in Right Ventricle: Blood flow is less affected because of lower intraventricular pressures.',
  'Ventricular Ejection (Late Systole): The ventricles continue to contract, ejecting blood into the aorta and pulmonary artery. The intraventricular pressure reaches its peak. Blood Flow in Left Ventricle: Coronary blood flow remains suppressed due to persistent compression of intramyocardial vessels. Subendocardial flow is particularly reduced. Blood Flow in Right Ventricle: Blood flow is relatively preserved because of lower wall tension and pressure.',
  'Isovolumetric Relaxation (Early Diastole): After ejection, the ventricles relax, and intraventricular pressure falls rapidly. The aortic valve closes, allowing blood to flow into the coronary arteries. Blood Flow in Left Ventricle: Coronary flow increases dramatically, reaching its peak. This phase accounts for the majority of left ventricular perfusion. Blood Flow in Right Ventricle: Flow increases moderately but is less pronounced than in the left ventricle.',
  'Ventricular Filling (Mid to Late Diastole): During diastole, the ventricles fill with blood from the atria. Ventricular pressure remains low, allowing coronary vessels to remain open. Blood Flow in Left Ventricle: Flow continues at a steady rate but decreases compared to early diastole. Blood Flow in Right Ventricle: Flow is steady and less phasic compared to the left ventricle.'

  'Cyclic Variation in Myocardial Flow in the Walls of the Right and Left Ventricles - Right Ventricle (RV): The right ventricular systolic pressure is low (approximately 15–25 mmHg), which means that the coronary arteries supplying the RV wall are not significantly compressed during contraction. Therefore, blood flow in the RV wall occurs relatively evenly during both systole and diastole. During Systole: blood flow occurs relatively evenly. During Diastole: Although the RV coronary perfusion increases during diastole (as in the LV), the difference is less pronounced compared to the left ventricle because systolic compression of the RV coronary vessels is mild. Summary: The RV experiences continuous coronary flow throughout the cardiac cycle, with only a minor dependence on diastolic relaxation.',
  'Cyclic Variation in Myocardial Flow in the Walls of the Right and Left Ventricles - Left Ventricle (LV): The left ventricular systolic pressure is much higher (approximately 120 mmHg), leading to significant compression of coronary vessels, especially in the subendocardium. This compression reduces or even temporarily halts blood flow in the LV myocardium during systole. During Systole: significant compression of coronary vessels, especially in the subendocardium, reduces or even temporarily halts blood flow. During Diastole: Blood flow to the LV myocardium occurs predominantly during diastole when the ventricular muscle relaxes, and the coronary vessels reopen. The coronary flow velocity in the LV is highest during early diastole, corresponding to rapid ventricular relaxation. Summary: In the LV, coronary flow is highly diastolic-dependent, unlike the RV, where it is more evenly distributed.',
  'Cyclic Variation in Subendocardial and Subepicardial Flow of the Left Ventricle - Subendocardium (Inner Layer): The subendocardium is the innermost layer of the myocardium, closest to the ventricular cavity. It is subjected to the highest intramural pressure during systole because it lies beneath the entire thickness of the contracting ventricular wall. This layer also experiences the greatest wall stress due to its proximity to the cavity pressure and is metabolically more active, requiring more oxygen. During Systole: During systole, the high intramural pressure almost completely occludes the subendocardial vessels, reducing blood flow to nearly zero. This makes the subendocardium highly dependent on diastolic perfusion. During Diastole: During diastole, relaxation of the ventricular wall relieves pressure on the subendocardial vessels, allowing blood flow to resume. Subendocardial flow is highest in early diastole. Clinical Relevance: The subendocardium is particularly susceptible to ischemia under conditions that reduce diastolic filling time (e.g., tachycardia) or lower coronary perfusion pressure (e.g., hypotension).',
  'Cyclic Variation in Subendocardial and Subepicardial Flow of the Left Ventricle - Subepicardium (Outer Layer): The subepicardium is the outermost layer of the myocardium, closest to the epicardium and coronary arteries. It is subjected to lower intramural pressure compared to the subendocardium because it lies further away from the ventricular cavity. During Systole: Although systolic compression affects the subepicardial vessels, it is much less pronounced than in the subendocardium. Some degree of blood flow continues during systole in this layer. During Diastole: Like the subendocardium, blood flow to the subepicardium increases during diastole, but the dependency on diastolic perfusion is less critical because systolic compression is minimal. Clinical Relevance: The subepicardium is less prone to ischemia compared to the subendocardium, as it experiences more consistent blood flow throughout the cardiac cycle.'

  'Reference Values for Oxygen Extraction and Arteriovenous Oxygen Difference (AVDO₂) in Coronary Circulation: Oxygen Extraction: The heart extracts 65-75% of the oxygen delivered by the coronary arteries under resting conditions. This is significantly higher compared to most other organs, such as skeletal muscles (20-25%) and the brain (30-35%).',
  'Reference Values for Oxygen Extraction and Arteriovenous Oxygen Difference (AVDO₂) in Coronary Circulation: Arteriovenous Oxygen Difference (AVDO₂): In the coronary circulation, the AVDO₂ is approximately 114 ml/L. This value is more than double the body average, which is around 50 ml/L.',
  'Uniqueness Compared to Other Organs - High Baseline Oxygen Extraction: The myocardium relies almost entirely on oxidative metabolism, and its oxygen extraction at rest is already close to maximum capacity. Other organs, like skeletal muscles, increase oxygen extraction only during increased activity. The heart, by contrast, cannot significantly increase oxygen extraction further during stress.',
  'Uniqueness Compared to Other Organs - High Oxygen Demand: The heart is a continuously active organ, with a high and constant metabolic demand. Even at rest, the heart\'s oxygen consumption is disproportionately high compared to its mass.',
  'Uniqueness Compared to Other Organs - Dependence on Increased Blood Flow: Since oxygen extraction is near maximal at rest, the coronary circulation compensates for increased oxygen demand (e.g., during exercise) by increasing coronary blood flow, not extraction. In most other organs, oxygen demand can be met by increasing extraction alone.',
  'Uniqueness Compared to Other Organs - Clinical Implications: The heart is highly sensitive to ischemia because it has little reserve capacity for increasing oxygen extraction. Any reduction in coronary blood flow quickly leads to ischemia, making the heart particularly vulnerable to conditions like atherosclerosis or tachycardia.'

  'Mechanism whereby coronary blood flow is coupled to myocardial workload: Coronary blood flow is tightly matched to the metabolic demands of the myocardium — a process known as metabolic autoregulation. As myocardial workload increases (e.g. during exercise or stress), oxygen consumption rises, but since the heart extracts oxygen near maximally at rest (≈70–80%), the only way to meet increased demand is to increase coronary blood flow. This coupling occurs primarily through local metabolic control, in which changes in myocardial metabolism lead to the release of vasodilator substances that act directly on coronary arterioles.',
  'Steps in Coupling Coronary Blood Flow to Myocardial Workload - Increased Myocardial Oxygen Demand: Myocardial workload rises due to factors like increased heart rate, contractility, and wall stress (as per Laplace\'s law: wall stress increases with greater pressure or volume). This leads to a higher rate of oxygen consumption and the need for increased oxygen delivery to the myocardium.',
  'Steps in Coupling Coronary Blood Flow to Myocardial Workload - Local Hypoxia and Metabolic Signals: As oxygen consumption increases, myocardial PO₂ (partial pressure of oxygen) decreases. This hypoxia, combined with increased workload, stimulates the production of vasodilatory metabolites, such as: Adenosine (from ATP breakdown during hypoxia). Carbon dioxide (CO₂). Hydrogen ions (H⁺) (from lactic acid due to anaerobic metabolism). Potassium ions (K⁺) (released during myocardial depolarizations). Lactate (produced during anaerobic metabolism).',
  'Steps in Coupling Coronary Blood Flow to Myocardial Workload - Vasodilation of Coronary Arterioles: These metabolites act on vascular smooth muscle cells of the coronary arterioles, causing vasodilation. Adenosine, the most potent vasodilator, binds to A2 receptors, activating adenylyl cyclase, increasing cAMP, and decreasing intracellular calcium levels, leading to smooth muscle relaxation.',
  'Steps in Coupling Coronary Blood Flow to Myocardial Workload - Flow-Mediated Vasodilation: As coronary blood flow increases, shear stress on endothelial cells rises. Shear stress stimulates endothelial cells to release nitric oxide (NO), a potent vasodilator that diffuses into vascular smooth muscle cells, triggering relaxation.',
  'Steps in Coupling Coronary Blood Flow to Myocardial Workload - Increased Coronary Flow Reserve: The coronary circulation relies on coronary flow reserve (CFR) to increase blood flow when oxygen demand rises. Since the myocardium already extracts 65–75% of oxygen from the coronary blood at rest, the only way to meet increased demand is by enhancing blood flow, not extraction.',
  'Humoral Mechanisms Causing Coronary Vasodilation - Adenosine: Source: Released from myocardial cells during hypoxia or ATP breakdown. Mechanism: Binds to A2 receptors on vascular smooth muscle. Activates adenylyl cyclase, increasing cAMP and reducing intracellular calcium levels, leading to smooth muscle relaxation. Effect: Potent, local coronary vasodilation during hypoxia or increased metabolic demand.',
  'Humoral Mechanisms Causing Coronary Vasodilation - Nitric Oxide (NO): Source: Produced by endothelial cells in response to: Shear stress from increased blood flow.

Mechanism: Stimulates endothelial cells to produce nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandins. Effect: Causes potent vasodilation and enhances coronary blood flow.',
  'Humoral Mechanisms Causing Coronary Vasodilation - Carbon Dioxide (CO₂) and Hydrogen Ions (H⁺): Source: Produced during increased metabolism and hypoxia.
