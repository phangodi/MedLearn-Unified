        'Emulsification by bile salts and lecithin: Bile salts and lecithin (a phospholipid) are amphipathic molecules that act as detergents surrounding large lipid droplets and breaking them into smaller droplets. This increases the total surface area, allowing better enzyme access. Emulsification does not involve enzymatic digestion, but it prepares lipids for enzyme action.',
        'Pancreatic lipase (main enzyme for triglycerides): Secreted in active form. Hydrolyzes triglycerides into monoglycerides and free fatty acids. Bile salts coat the lipid droplets, preventing pancreatic lipase from binding. The pancreas secretes colipase as an inactive precursor (procolipase), activated by trypsin. Colipase displaces bile salts, allowing pancreatic lipase to bind to the lipid-water interface and digest triglycerides.',

Micelles: bile salts + cholesterol + phospholipids. Core: hydrophobic lipid digestion products. Outer layer: amphipathic bile salts. Micelles are small disks that act as shuttles transporting lipids to the brush-border membrane of enterocytes. Micelle formation is required for absorption.

The hydrophobic nature of lipid digestion products allows them to passively diffuse across the lipid bilayer of enterocytes.

Sodium is absorbed by multiple mechanisms: in the jejunum via sodium-coupled nutrient cotransporters; in the ileum via parallel sodium-hydrogen and chloride-bicarbonate exchangers achieving net sodium chloride absorption; and in the colon via aldosterone-regulated epithelial sodium channels, ENaC; basolateral Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase is common to all segments. Chloride follows sodium paracellularly and via chloride-bicarbonate exchange. Potassium is passively absorbed in the small intestine; the colon may secrete potassium, especially when aldosterone is elevated. Iron is absorbed in the duodenum and proximal jejunum. Non-heme iron: ferrireductase in the brush border reduces ferric to ferrous iron, which enters via the apical DMT1 transporter; inside the enterocyte it is stored as ferritin, then exported basolaterally via ferroportin into the blood where it binds transferrin. Heme iron is taken up by endocytosis, with heme-oxygenase releasing ferrous iron intracellularly. Hepcidin inhibits ferroportin, reducing iron export. Calcium is absorbed primarily in the duodenum and jejunum by active transcellular transport regulated by 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3: calcium enters via TRPV6 channels on the apical membrane, is bound by calbindin in the cytosol, and exported at the basolateral membrane via the PMCA calcium-ATPase and sodium-calcium exchanger. Passive paracellular calcium absorption also occurs throughout the small intestine.'
