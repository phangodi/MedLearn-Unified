          raw: 'ATP plays four crucial roles in muscle function. First, ATP binding to the myosin head after the power stroke causes cross-bridge detachment by reducing myosin affinity for actin. Second, ATP hydrolysis to ADP and inorganic phosphate by myosin ATPase provides energy to recock the myosin head into its high-energy conformation for the next cycle. Third, SERCA pumps use ATP to actively transport calcium ions from the sarcoplasm back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum against their concentration gradient, which is essential for relaxation. Fourth, sodium-potassium ATPase pumps maintain ionic gradients necessary for action potential generation. Rigor mortis occurs after death when ATP production ceases due to lack of oxygen and metabolic activity. Without ATP, myosin heads cannot detach from actin filaments after the power stroke, resulting in formation of permanent cross-bridges. Additionally, the sarcoplasmic reticulum degrades and releases calcium ions into the cytosol. Although calcium exposes the myosin-binding sites on actin, the absence of ATP prevents cross-bridge detachment. This creates a sustained contracted state where muscles remain locked in place, causing the characteristic postmortem stiffening known as rigor mortis.'
