          'The conduction velocity of action potentials in peripheral nerves is influenced by two main factors: axonal diameter and myelination. These factors affect the cable properties of the axon, specifically the time constant and length constant, which ultimately determine the speed of action potential propagation. Increasing Axonal Diameter: Internal Resistance (Ri): The internal resistance of an axon is inversely proportional to its cross-sectional area (A = πr²). As the diameter of the axon increases, the internal resistance decreases. Effect on Conduction Velocity: Decreased internal resistance (Ri) allows current to spread more easily through the axon, increasing the length constant (λ). A larger length constant means that current can spread further along the axon, allowing the action potential to propagate more quickly.',
          'Myelin Sheath: Myelin acts as an insulating layer around the axon. It increases the membrane resistance (Rm) and decreases the membrane capacitance (Cm). Increased Membrane Resistance: Higher membrane resistance forces the current to flow through the axon rather than leak out across the membrane, ensuring efficient propagation of the action potential. Decreased Membrane Capacitance: Lower membrane capacitance reduces the time constant, allowing the membrane to reach the threshold potential more quickly in response to incoming current. Saltatory Conduction: In myelinated axons, action potentials "jump" from one node of Ranvier to the next, a process known as saltatory conduction. Nodes of Ranvier are gaps in the myelin sheath where ion channels are concentrated, allowing for rapid depolarization at these points. This mechanism greatly increases conduction velocity as the action potential does not need to propagate continuously along the entire axon but instead leaps from node to node.',
