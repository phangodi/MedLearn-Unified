  'Starting Volume (Baseline Volume): The initial volume of blood in the vessel affects its ability to expand further in response to pressure. At low baseline volumes, vessels are more compliant because there is more room for expansion. At high baseline volumes, vessels approach their elastic limit, reducing compliance as they become less capable of stretching.',
  'Distensibility (Elastic Properties): refers to the intrinsic elasticity of the vessel wall, which determines how easily it can stretch in response to pressure. Arteries have lower distensibility due to thicker walls with more elastic fibers and smooth muscle, making them less compliant. Veins are more distensible because they have thinner walls with fewer elastic fibers, allowing greater expansion.'

  'Arteries (Low Compliance): Arteries are low-compliance vessels because their walls contain thick layers of elastic fibers and smooth muscle, making them stiff and resistant to expansion. Designed to handle high pressure from the heart\'s systolic contraction and maintain steady blood flow. Compliance is inversely related to pressure; arteries are less compliant at higher pressures.',
  'Arterioles (Very Low Compliance): Arterioles have the lowest compliance in the vascular system. Their primary role is resistance regulation to control blood flow and pressure to downstream capillaries. Small changes in intravascular pressure result in negligible changes in volume.',
  'Capillaries (Minimal Compliance): Capillaries are essentially non-compliant as their thin walls are designed for exchange of gases, nutrients, and waste, not for storage or expansion. Any increase in pressure can damage capillaries due to their delicate structure.',
  'Veins (High Compliance): Veins are high-compliance vessels, often referred to as capacitance vessels. Their thin walls allow significant expansion in response to increased blood volume at low pressures. Veins can store up to 60–70% of total blood volume in the circulation. Compliance decreases at higher pressures as veins reach their elastic limit.',
  'Pulmonary Vessels (Intermediate Compliance): Pulmonary arteries and veins are more compliant than systemic arteries but less compliant than systemic veins. Designed to handle lower pressures and facilitate steady blood flow through the lungs.',
  'Comparison: The distensibility of the venous system is ~ 8 times that of the arterial system. For a given increase in pressure, veins can accommodate 8 times more blood than arteries of similar size. The compliance of the venous system is 24 times that of the corresponding arteries. It\'s distensibility is 8 times higher, and it\'s volume is 3 times larger (8 × 3 = 24).'

  'Critical closing pressure (CCP): The lowest perfusion pressure at which a given vessel remains open and blood flow is maintained. When arterial pressure falls below this level, the vessel collapses.',
  'Critical closing pressure is a positive value: This is due to vascular smooth muscle tone and extravascular pressure. Smooth m. tone ↑ → CCP ↑. Extravascular P ↑ → CCP ↑.',
  'In the arteries: the critical closing pressure is higher than the average circulatory filling pressure after death (~7 mmHg); therefore, the arteries collapse and, during autopsy, become filled with air.'

  'Transmural pressure (Pt): pressure difference across the wall of a hollow organ, causes the wall to stretch.',
  'Wall tension (T): the tangential force in response to the distending pressure.',
  'Law of Laplace: T = Pt · r. Blood vessels are thicker: T = (Pt · r) / h. Consequences: tension is proportional to vessel radius and transmural pressure. It is inversely proportional to wall thickness.',
  'The Law of Laplace shows which vascular segments are at high risk: Veins – low risk: low pressure, large radius. Capillaries – low risk: low pressure, small radius. Arterioles – low risk: high pressure, small radius, thick wall. Muscular arteries – low risk: high pressure, medium radius, thick wall. Aorta / elastic arteries – high risk: high pressure, large radius, relatively thin wall.',
  'Therefore, vessel rupture due to high wall stress is most likely in the aorta, and wall weakening can initiate a vicious cycle of aneurysm formation.'

  'Hydraulic resistance: the opposition to blood flow through a vessel, determined by the vessel\'s geometry and blood viscosity. Hydraulic resistance measures the opposition to fluid flow in a system or vessel. It is defined by the relationship: R = ΔP / Q, where ΔP is the pressure difference across the vessel, and Q is the flow rate. Units: mmHg·min/L or dyne·s/cm⁵. Formula (Poiseuille\'s Law, simplified): Resistance (R) = 8ηL / πr⁴ where η = viscosity, L = length, r = radius.',
  'Hydraulic Conductance: the reciprocal of resistance and quantifies how easily fluid flows through a system. It is defined by: G = Q / ΔP = 1/R. Units: L/min/mmHg or cm⁵/dyne·s.',
  'Resistance in Series: When resistances are added in series, the total resistance is the sum of individual resistances: Rtotal = R1 + R2 + R3 + ... Effect: Adding resistances in series increases the total resistance, reducing the overall flow for a given pressure difference. Example: Blood flow through sequential vascular segments (e.g., arteries → arterioles → capillaries → veins).',
  'Resistance in Parallel: When resistances are added in parallel, the total resistance is calculated as: 1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ... Effect: Adding resistances in parallel decreases the total resistance, increasing the overall flow for a given pressure difference. Example: Blood flow through capillary beds, where many vessels operate in parallel.',
  'It can also be described by conductance, which is the reciprocal of resistance: 1/Rtotal = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + ... → G = 1/R → Gtotal = G1 + G2 + G3 + ...',

  'Arteries: Structure and Function: Large diameter, thick elastic walls, and low compliance. Serve as conduits for blood flow from the heart to peripheral tissues. Contribution to PVR: Minimal, due to their large diameters which offer little resistance. Their elasticity allows for the dampening of pulsatile flow from the heart, maintaining a more continuous flow downstream. Blood Pressure: Highest pressure, ranging from ~120 mmHg (systolic) to ~80 mmHg (diastolic) in the aorta and large arteries. Pressure decreases progressively as blood flows downstream. Cross-sectional Area: Small total cross-sectional area due to relatively few large arteries. Flow Velocity: Highest velocity due to small cross-sectional area and high pressure. Blood Volume: Contain ~10-15% of total blood volume, functioning primarily as conduits.',
  'Arterioles: Structure and Function: Small diameters, thick muscular walls with smooth muscle, and high responsiveness to autonomic and local factors. Exhibit the highest degree of vasoconstriction and vasodilation. Contribution to PVR: Primary site of vascular resistance, accounting for ~50-70% of total PVR. Small diameter significantly increases resistance according to Poiseuille\'s law. Resistance is dynamically adjusted through the contraction/relaxation of smooth muscle in response to: Sympathetic nervous system (e.g., norepinephrine causing vasoconstriction). Local factors (e.g., nitric oxide causing vasodilation). Hormonal influences (e.g., angiotensin II, epinephrine). Role: Control blood pressure and flow distribution to various tissues. Major site of pressure drop in the circulatory system. Blood Pressure: Largest pressure drop occurs here (from ~80 mmHg to ~30 mmHg) due to high resistance. Blood pressure drop in the systemic resistance vessels (arterioles): 60 mmHg. Cross-sectional Area: Greater cross-sectional area than arteries due to the branching of smaller vessels. Blood Volume: Contain a very small percentage of blood volume due to their small size.',
  'Capillaries: Structure and Function: Narrow, thin-walled vessels (only one cell layer thick) with no smooth muscle. Vastly distributed, arranged in parallel networks, increasing total cross-sectional area. Contribution to PVR: Moderate resistance due to small diameters, but their parallel arrangement reduces overall resistance in this segment. The large surface area ensures efficient diffusion of gases, nutrients, and waste. Blood Pressure: Moderate pressure (~30 mmHg at the arterial end to ~10 mmHg at the venous end). Role: Focused on exchange of substances, not major resistance regulation. Cross-sectional Area: Largest total cross-sectional area in the circulatory system due to their vast number (~600-800x larger than the aorta). This maximizes surface area for nutrient and gas exchange. Total cross sectional area of capillaries: 3000 cm². Flow Velocity: Lowest velocity due to the high cross-sectional area, allowing time for exchange of gases and nutrients. Average flow velocity in the capillaries: 0.03 cm/s. Blood Volume: Contain ~5% of total blood volume, sufficient for effective exchange.',
  'Venules: Structure and Function: Larger diameters than capillaries, with thin walls containing a small amount of smooth muscle. Contribution to PVR: Low resistance due to increased diameter relative to capillaries. Limited ability to regulate resistance through mild vasoconstriction or vasodilation. Blood Pressure: Low pressure (~10 mmHg) as blood begins to return to the heart. Role: Transition vessels that collect blood from capillaries and begin returning it to the heart. Cross-sectional Area: Decreases compared to capillaries as blood begins to merge into larger vessels. Flow Velocity: Velocity begins to increase as vessels converge and cross-sectional area decreases. Blood Volume: Moderate blood volume, as they collect blood from capillaries.',
  'Veins: Structure and Function: Large diameter, thin walls, and highly compliant vessels with little smooth muscle. Contain valves to prevent backflow, especially in lower extremities. Contribution to PVR: Minimal resistance due to their large diameter and low tone. High compliance means they act as volume reservoirs, accommodating large amounts of blood (60-70% of total blood volume). Blood Pressure: Lowest pressure, often near 0 mmHg or even slightly negative in the large veins near the heart. Role: Facilitate venous return to the heart with minimal resistance. Cross-sectional Area: Small total cross-sectional area relative to capillaries but larger than arteries. Flow Velocity: Moderate velocity, increasing further as blood approaches the heart. Blood Volume: Largest blood volume reservoir (~60-70%), due to high compliance and ability to stretch and store blood.',
  'Distribution of blood volumes: ~84% of the total blood volume is in the systemic circulation. ~7% of the total blood volume is in the heart. ~9% is in the pulmonary vessels.

  'Flow velocity (cm/sec): Arteries (18 cm/sec → 5 cm/sec) → capillaries (0.02-0.1 cm/sec). Average flow velocity in the aorta: 22.5 cm/s.',
  'Flow velocity is inversely proportional to cross-sectional area: v = Q / A.',
