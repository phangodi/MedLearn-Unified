  'Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR): energy expenditure determined under standard conditions. 6500 kJ/day (75 W; 1560 kcal) – 7100 kJ/day (100 W; 1700 kcal). Reference values: BMR adult male/female: 7100/6300 kJ/day.',
  'Standard conditions for BMR measurement: 1. In the morning, after waking up. 2. In physical and mental rest (in lying position). 3. At least 8 hours after the last meal. 4. In indifferent ambient temperature. 5. The core temperature must be normal. 6. In a drug-free condition.',

  'Body size, age and sex influence BMR: There is a linear relationship between body surface area and metabolic rate. Energy turnover decreases with age in both sexes. BMR is higher in men than in women (adipose tissue, low E consumption). Regarding the lean body mass, the gender difference is insignificant! The average adult body surface area is 1.7 m2.',
  'Thyroid hormones (T3/T4): Fundamentally determine the BMR. Low hormone levels reduce the BMR to the 60% of normal value. High hormone levels increase the BMR by the 80% of normal value. Long-term starvation decreases T3/T4 levels.',
  'Biological rhythms (circadian rhythm) influence BMR: Daily fluctuations of neuro-humoral regulation (e.g.: hypothalamo-hypophyseo-adrenal system: CRH-ACTH-glucocorticoids). Sleep-wake cycle (sleep 8 hours and go to bed early).',
  'Body temperature influences BMR: With fever, every 1°C rise in body temperature results in approximately a 10–13 % increase in metabolic rate. Inflammations, infections: energy demand of the immune system increases (secretion of catecholamins and glucocorticoids, prostaglandin synthesis, cytokine release etc.). Ambient temperature: Metabolism is fully governed by intrinsic factors only within the thermoneutral zone of ambient temperatures. At ambient temperatures outside the thermoneutral zone, a large fraction of total energy is used for thermoregulation (the BMR is strongly influenced by the ambient temperature).',

  'Diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT): increase in heat production and energy expenditure, occurs several hours after eating. Caused by increased energy demand of the GI system.

  'Carbohydrate components of food: Monosaccharides: glucose, fructose (fruits, fruit juices). Disaccharides: sucrose ("refined carbohydrates"; sweets, drinks – should be less than 10% of daily energy requirement (approx. 50 g)), lactose (breast milk, dairy products). Polysaccharides: starch and cellulose (cereals, potatoes, corn, rice, beans), glycogen (animal origin). Sugar alcohols: hydrogen-reduced forms of monosaccharides. Slowly raise the blood glucose level, can be induced in the diet of diabetics (xylitol, mannitol, sorbitol). They are not metabolized (osmotic diarrhoea).',
  'Anti-ketogenic effect of carbohydrates: When carbohydrates are sufficient, glucose provides oxaloacetate, a compound necessary for the TCA cycle to function fully and oxidize acetyl-CoA derived from fats. Without enough glucose, fats are incompletely oxidized, leading to the accumulation of ketone bodies (ketosis). Thus, carbohydrates prevent excessive ketone production, especially during fasting or low-carb diets.',

  'Glycemic index (GI): a number between 0 and 100 that indicates how fast the CHs in a given food is absorbed. GI = 100 – absorption rate of glucose. GI = 0 – absorption rate of food without CHs. Low GI value (slow CHs): small and steady increase in blood glucose level; less insulin; less glucose and fat are stored. High GI value (fast CHs): high and fast increase in blood glucose level; more insulin; hunger because of the fast decrease in blood glucose; more glucose and fat are stored.',

  'Contribution of lipids to energy production: Lipids provide the highest energy yield of all macronutrients, producing 39 kJ/g (9 kcal/g). Fat metabolism occurs via β-oxidation in the mitochondria, where fatty acids are broken down into acetyl-CoA, which enters the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) to produce ATP. Lipids are stored in adipose tissue and used as a long-term energy reserve, especially during fasting or prolonged physical activity.',
