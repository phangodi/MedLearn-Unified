  'Pressure-volume relationship in the left ventricle: shows the pressure–volume relationship in the left ventricle during the cardiac cycle. Includes two important curves: the diastolic pressure curve (blue) shows pressure in the ventricle before contraction as it fills, and the systolic pressure curve (green) shows the maximum pressure the ventricle can develop at each volume during contraction.',
  'Diastolic pressure curve (blue): created by filling the ventricle with increasing volumes of blood and measuring the end-diastolic pressure (EDP) before contraction. Up to approximately 150 mL, the pressure increases slowly, meaning the ventricle is compliant (can stretch easily). Above 150 mL, pressure rises sharply because the fibrous tissue and pericardium limit further stretch, making the ventricle become less compliant (stiffer). This part of the curve reflects passive tension in the ventricle.',
  'Systolic pressure curve (green): created by recording the peak systolic pressure during contraction at different levels of filling (volume). The ventricle generates higher pressure as volume increases up to an optimal point (150–170 mL) due to greater stretch leading to better overlap of actin and myosin filaments and stronger contraction (Frank–Starling law). Beyond 170 mL, pressure starts to fall because the muscle is overstretched and actin and myosin filaments cannot form strong cross-bridges, weakening contraction. This is the active tension part of the length–tension relationship.',
  'Clinical pressures: in a normal left ventricle, the maximum systolic pressure can range between 250–300 mmHg, depending on contractility and nervous system stimulation. In a normal right ventricle, the systolic pressure is much lower, typically 60–80 mmHg, because it pumps blood into the low-pressure pulmonary circulation.',
  'Sarcomere length ↔ End-diastolic volume (EDV): in the PV loop, the horizontal axis (ventricular volume) reflects sarcomere length at the start of contraction. As EDV increases (e.g., from 50 mL to 120 mL), the cardiac fibers are stretched more, increasing sarcomere length. This is directly linked to active tension according to the Frank–Starling law: increased length leads to increased cross-bridge overlap and increased contraction force.',
  'Passive tension ↔ Diastolic pressure curve (blue line): the blue diastolic pressure curve represents the pressure the ventricle develops before contraction as it is filled. This corresponds to passive tension at the cellular level: stretching the muscle increases resistance due to elastic components (like titin). A steeper blue curve indicates a stiffer ventricle (less compliant).',
  'Active tension ↔ Systolic pressure curve (green line): the green systolic pressure curve shows the maximum pressure the ventricle can generate at each volume. This curve reflects the active tension produced by cross-bridge cycling in cardiac muscle fibers. It peaks at optimal volume (approximately 150–170 mL), and beyond this, tension and pressure decline because sarcomeres are overstretched, leading to reduced filament overlap.',
  'Velocity of shortening ↔ Rate of ejection: during ejection phase of the loop, the ventricle shortens while ejecting blood. Velocity of fiber shortening depends on afterload (aortic pressure) and contractility. When afterload is high, shortening slows; when contractility is high (e.g., via sympathetic stimulation), shortening is faster. This is reflected by dP/dtmax, the slope of pressure rise during isovolumetric contraction.',
  'Ventricular dP/dt: the rate of pressure change (dP) with time (dt) during isovolemic contraction of the cardiac ventricles, occurring in the period before the aortic valve and/or pulmonic valve opens, when there is no considerable change in left atrial and/or right atrial pressure.',
  'dP/dtmax: occurs during isovolumic contraction, between Phase I and Phase II, when the mitral and aortic valves are closed, and the ventricle builds pressure rapidly without volume change. This is the maximum rate of pressure rise.',
  'dP/dtmin: occurs during isovolumic relaxation, between Phase III and Phase IV, when the ventricle relaxes quickly after ejection but before the mitral valve opens. This is the fastest drop in pressure.'

  'Preload: the initial stretching of the cardiac muscle fibers at the end of diastole, just before the onset of systole. It is essentially the load or tension on the ventricular walls immediately before they contract. This stretching is influenced by the volume of blood filling the ventricles at the end of diastole, known as the end-diastolic volume (EDV). The greater the EDV, the higher the preload, which in turn influences the force of the subsequent contraction according to the Frank-Starling law.',
  'End-diastolic ventricular pressure (EDP): directly correlates with the stretch of the ventricular walls because it reflects the pressure within the ventricles when they are filled with blood at the end of diastole. Since preload is associated with the tension in the myocardial fibers just before contraction, measuring the pressure in the ventricle at this phase gives an accurate estimate of how much the fibers are stretched.',
  'Atrial pressure: atrial pressure, particularly left atrial pressure for the left ventricle and right atrial pressure for the right ventricle, reflects the pressure that propels blood into the ventricles during diastole. While it provides an indirect measure of ventricular filling, atrial pressure can be used to estimate preload because it contributes to the pressure gradient that determines ventricular filling.',
  'Central venous pressure (CVP): CVP is an estimate of the right atrial pressure and reflects the pressure within the venous system that returns blood to the heart. CVP reflects right atrial pressure, which determines right ventricular filling. CVP indicates the volume status of the venous return to the right side of the heart, which affects how much blood is available to fill the ventricles during diastole.',
  'Why end-diastolic ventricular pressure is most reliable: EDP is the most reliable estimate of preload because it directly measures the pressure within the ventricles, providing a closer approximation of the tension experienced by the ventricular muscle fibers. This is crucial for accurately assessing the true load on the myocardium before contraction. The pressure in the ventricle at the end of diastole directly relates to the degree of myocardial fiber stretch, which determines the initial tension in the ventricular walls. Unlike atrial pressure and CVP, which can be influenced by other factors such as atrial compliance, respiratory changes, and venous return fluctuations, ventricular pressure reflects the conditions within the ventricles themselves, making it a more precise reflection of the actual preload on the cardiac muscle. EDP aligns with the principles of the Frank-Starling law, which states that the force of contraction is proportional to the initial fiber length (or preload). Accurately measuring this pressure helps in predicting the heart\'s response to changes in volume load and the resulting cardiac output.'

  'Afterload: the resistance or load that the heart must work against to eject blood during systole. It represents the maximal tension developed in the ventricular wall during systole as it contracts and pushes blood into the aorta (left ventricle) or pulmonary artery (right ventricle). Afterload is closely related to the pressure that the heart needs to generate to overcome the arterial pressure and open the aortic or pulmonary valve for blood ejection.',
  'Why systolic arterial pressure estimates afterload: systolic arterial pressure is commonly used to estimate afterload because it reflects the pressure the left ventricle must overcome to eject blood during systole. During systole, the left ventricle contracts to propel blood into the aorta. The pressure within the aorta at this time is the systolic arterial pressure. The ventricle must generate a pressure exceeding this to open the aortic valve and initiate blood flow. The magnitude of the systolic arterial pressure determines the pressure gradient the ventricle must overcome. Higher systolic pressures indicate greater resistance, thereby increasing afterload. While systolic arterial pressure is a useful surrogate for afterload, afterload is also influenced by factors like arterial compliance and vascular resistance. However, in clinical practice, systolic arterial pressure provides a convenient and accessible measure to estimate afterload and guide therapeutic decisions.'

  'Starling heart-lung preparation: an experimental setup that isolates the heart and lungs of an animal (typically a dog) while maintaining their natural blood supply and function. The preparation is used to study the intrinsic properties of the heart, particularly how it responds to changes in preload and afterload without neural or hormonal input. In this setup: the heart is denervated, meaning there is no influence from the autonomic nervous system; blood flow through the heart and lungs is maintained using an artificial circulation loop; the preparation allows for precise control of blood volume (preload) and resistance (afterload) in the vascular system.',
  'Adaptation to changes in preload: a transplanted, denervated heart lacks neural regulation and depends solely on intrinsic mechanisms to adapt to changes in preload and afterload. Preload refers to the volume of blood filling the ventricles at the end of diastole (end-diastolic volume). The Starling preparation can vary the volume of blood entering the heart, allowing researchers to observe how the heart responds. The Frank-Starling law states that the stroke volume of the heart increases in response to an increase in the volume of blood filling the heart (preload). This is because the increased stretch of the ventricular muscle fibers during diastole leads to stronger contractions during systole. In a denervated heart, this intrinsic property allows it to pump out more blood when preload increases, maintaining cardiac output without external regulation.',
  'Adaptation to changes in afterload: afterload refers to the resistance the heart must overcome to eject blood during systole, often represented by the arterial pressure. The Starling heart-lung preparation can simulate increased afterload by adding resistance to the outflow tract. The heart responds by increasing contractile force to overcome the added resistance, although this mechanism is less pronounced compared to the response to changes in preload. This intrinsic ability allows a denervated heart to adapt to moderate changes in afterload by adjusting its contractility to maintain stroke volume and cardiac output.',
  'Frank-Starling law of the heart: the force of contraction of the cardiac muscle is directly proportional to the initial length of the muscle fibers (i.e., the degree of stretch) at the end of diastole. In other words, within physiological limits, the more the heart muscle is stretched during filling (greater preload), the stronger the force of contraction and the greater the volume of blood ejected (stroke volume). When the heart receives more blood during diastole (increased preload), the myocardial fibers are stretched, leading to optimal overlap of actin and myosin filaments. This results in a stronger contraction during systole. This intrinsic property ensures that the heart can match its output to the volume of blood returned to it, maintaining equilibrium between the input and output of the heart.',
  'Resting length (diastolic volume) determines the contraction force: Frank-Starling mechanism. Calcium sensitivity increases (calcium channels may be involved). Works also in isolated heart. Contraction force may increase without change in length: positive inotropic effect. Background: intracellular calcium increases. Effect of sympathetic stimulation.',
  'Frank Starling law of the heart: stroke volume of the heart increases in response to an increase in the volume of blood filling the heart (the end diastolic volume), or the strength of the heart\'s systolic contraction is directly proportional to its diastolic expansion (end diastolic volume).'

  'Role in maintaining equal cardiac output: the Frank-Starling law of the heart plays a crucial role in maintaining balance between the cardiac output of the left and right ventricles, ensuring that the volume of blood pumped by both sides of the heart remains equal over time. This balance is essential to prevent blood accumulation in either the systemic or pulmonary circulation, which could lead to detrimental effects such as pulmonary congestion or systemic edema.',
  'Mechanism: the Frank-Starling law states that the force of contraction of the cardiac muscle increases in response to an increase in the volume of blood filling the heart (the preload). When the ventricles fill with more blood during diastole, the myocardial fibers are stretched to a greater extent, leading to more optimal alignment of the actin and myosin filaments. This results in a stronger contraction during systole and an increased stroke volume.',
  'Balance between right and left ventricles: blood returning from the systemic circulation fills the right ventricle, which then pumps it into the pulmonary circulation. The left ventricle receives blood from the pulmonary circulation and pumps it into the systemic circulation. If the output of one ventricle were to exceed that of the other, there would be an imbalance in the volume of blood in the pulmonary or systemic circulation. The Frank-Starling law ensures that if there is a slight increase in the volume of blood returning to one ventricle (e.g., the right ventricle due to increased venous return), that ventricle will respond by increasing its stroke volume to pump the additional volume effectively.',
  'Automatic adjustment of stroke volume: if, for example, the right ventricle pumps more blood into the pulmonary circulation than the left ventricle ejects into the systemic circulation, the increased return of blood to the left atrium (and consequently the left ventricle) results in a greater end-diastolic volume (preload) in the left ventricle. According to the Frank-Starling law, this increase in preload leads to a stronger contraction of the left ventricle, increasing its stroke volume to match that of the right ventricle. This mechanism prevents the buildup of blood in the pulmonary circulation and maintains equal cardiac output between the two ventricles.',
  'Prevention of circulatory imbalances: the Frank-Starling mechanism ensures that small, moment-to-moment differences in the blood volume pumped by the right and left ventricles are automatically corrected. By adjusting the stroke volume in response to changes in preload, the heart can maintain equilibrium in the blood flow between the pulmonary and systemic circulations.',
  'Outputs of right and left heart are interdependent: outputs of the right and left heart are interdependent because they are connected in series. Flow output of the right and left heart cannot differ significantly, they are interdependent. Since the systemic and pulmonary circulations are connected in series, blood flow is identical in both circuits. For a steady state, any change in flow in one circuit (e.g., due to heart failure) will affect the other circuit because they are serially connected.'
