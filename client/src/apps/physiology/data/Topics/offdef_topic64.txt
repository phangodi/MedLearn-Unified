  'Functional divisions of the stomach (secretion): Oxyntic (HCl producing) portion and Gastrin producing portion.',
  'Oxyntic (HCl producing) portion: Located in the body and fundus of the stomach. Contains oxyntic glands that secrete acid and enzymes essential for digestion. Cell types and secretions: Parietal (Oxyntic) Cells — secrete HCl and Intrinsic Factor. Chief (Peptic) Cells — secrete Pepsinogen. Mucous Neck Cells — secrete Mucus. Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) Cells — secrete Histamine, stimulating parietal cells to increase HCl secretion.',
  'Gastrin producing portion (Pyloric/Antral Region): Located in the antrum of the stomach. Contains pyloric glands that primarily secrete mucus for protection and gastrin to regulate acid secretion. Cell types: G Cells — secrete Gastrin. Mucous Neck Cells — secrete Mucus & Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻). D Cells — secrete Somatostatin, acting as a negative feedback regulator preventing excessive acid production.',

  'Parietal (Oxyntic) Cells — secretions: Hydrochloric Acid (HCl): maintains a low gastric pH (1-3), which activates pepsinogen into pepsin (an active protease), provides an acidic environment to help digest proteins, and kills bacteria and pathogens ingested with food. Intrinsic Factor: a glycoprotein essential for vitamin B12 absorption in the ileum; its deficiency leads to pernicious anemia due to impaired red blood cell formation.',
  'Chief (Peptic) Cells — secretions: Pepsinogen (inactive enzyme precursor); converted into pepsin in the presence of HCl; pepsin is an active protease that breaks down proteins into smaller peptides.',
  'Mucous Neck Cells — secretions: Mucus (Bicarbonate-Rich Mucus): forms a protective barrier over the gastric mucosa to prevent acid damage; Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) in mucus neutralizes HCl near the epithelial surface; helps prevent the formation of gastric ulcers.',

  'Morphological transformation of the parietal cell for secretion: Resting state — H⁺/K⁺ ATPase stored in Tubulovesicles inside the cell. Active state — Tubulovesicles fuse with the apical membrane to form Canaliculus, greatly expanding the surface area for secretion.',
  'Step 1 — H⁺ production: CO₂ produced by aerobic metabolism (parietal cells have many mitochondria) diffuses into the cell; combines with H₂O under carbonic anhydrase (CA) to form H₂CO₃; which dissociates into H⁺ and HCO₃⁻.',
  'Step 2 — H⁺ secretion into lumen: The H⁺/K⁺ ATPase (proton pump) on the apical/canalicular membrane actively transports H⁺ into the gastric lumen in exchange for K⁺ (which re-enters cell via K⁺ channel). This requires ATP and occurs against the electrochemical gradient.',
  'Step 3 — HCO₃⁻ exchange: At the basolateral membrane, an anion exchanger (Cl⁻-HCO₃⁻ exchanger) transports HCO₃⁻ into the bloodstream while bringing Cl⁻ into the parietal cell. The HCO₃⁻ entering the blood temporarily raises blood pH — the "alkaline tide". The Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger on the basolateral membrane removes excess H⁺. Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase on the basolateral membrane maintains Na⁺ and K⁺ gradients.',
  'Step 4 — Cl⁻ secretion and HCl formation: Cl⁻ ions transported into the cell diffuse through Cl⁻ channels on the apical membrane into the gastric lumen; in the lumen, H⁺ and Cl⁻ combine to form HCl. Final secretion contains HCl (~155 mEq/L), K⁺ (~15 mEq/L), Na⁺ (~30 mEq/L), and H₂O (by osmosis).',
  'Clinical relevance: Proton pump inhibitors (e.g., omeprazole) block H⁺/K⁺ ATPase, inhibiting gastric acid secretion; used in GERD and peptic ulcer disease. H₂ receptor blockers (e.g., cimetidine) block histamine-stimulated acid secretion.',

  'Role of HCl in protein digestion: HCl denatures proteins, unfolding their complex structures and exposing peptide bonds for enzymatic hydrolysis. It activates pepsinogen (a zymogen secreted by chief cells) into pepsin, the active enzyme responsible for protein digestion. Pepsin functions optimally at a pH of 1.5–2, which is maintained by HCl. Pepsin cleaves proteins into smaller peptides, making them more accessible for further digestion by pancreatic proteases in the small intestine.',
  'Role of HCl in carbohydrate digestion: HCl has a limited direct role in carbohydrate digestion because salivary amylase (ptyalin) is responsible for breaking down starches. However, HCl inactivates salivary amylase by lowering the gastric pH, halting carbohydrate digestion in the stomach. Further digestion of carbohydrates continues in the small intestine via pancreatic amylase.',
  'Activation of pepsinogen: Pepsinogen is secreted as an inactive zymogen by chief cells to prevent autodigestion of gastric cells. HCl triggers pepsinogen activation by lowering the stomach\'s pH. The low pH induces a conformational change, causing pepsinogen to cleave itself (autocatalysis) into pepsin, its active form. Once activated, pepsin can further activate more pepsinogen in a positive feedback loop, enhancing protein digestion. Optimal pH for conversion: 1.8–3.5; pH >7.2 creates irreversible inactivation.',
  'Role of HCl in defense against infections: The acidic environment of the stomach (pH 1–2) acts as a chemical barrier, destroying most bacteria, viruses, and parasites before they enter the intestines. The low pH inhibits the colonization of harmful bacteria, reducing the risk of foodborne infections and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). The acidic environment also solubilizes minerals like iron (Fe²⁺) and calcium, aiding their absorption in the duodenum.',

  'Acetylcholine (ACh) — Neurocrine Pathway: Source: released from postganglionic parasympathetic (vagal) nerve fibers innervating the gastric mucosa. Receptor: Muscarinic M3 receptors on parietal cells. Signal transduction: ACh binds to M3 receptors → activates phospholipase C → hydrolyzes membrane phospholipids → produces inositol triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG) → IP3 stimulates Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores → DAG and Ca²⁺ activate protein kinases → enhance H⁺ secretion via H⁺/K⁺ ATPase. Indirect effect: ACh also stimulates ECL cells (via M3) to release histamine, which further stimulates acid secretion. Blocked by: atropine (M3 muscarinic receptor antagonist).',
  'Histamine — Paracrine Pathway: Source: secreted by Enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells in the gastric mucosa (oxyntic region). Receptor: H2 histamine receptors on parietal cells. Signal transduction: Histamine binds to H2 receptors → coupled to Gs protein → activates adenylyl cyclase → increases cAMP production → cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA) → enhances H⁺ secretion via H⁺/K⁺ ATPase. Blocked by: H2 receptor blockers (e.g., cimetidine).',
  'Gastrin — Endocrine (Hormonal) Pathway: Source: secreted by G cells in the pyloric glands of the gastric antrum; exists as G17 (17 amino acids, most abundant) and G34 (34 amino acids). Receptor: Cholecystokinin-B (CCK-B / CCK₂) receptors on parietal cells. Signal transduction: Gastrin binds to CCK-B receptors → activates phospholipase C (same as ACh) → produces IP3 and DAG → increases Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores → Ca²⁺ and DAG activate protein kinases → stimulate H⁺ secretion via H⁺/K⁺ ATPase. Indirect effect: Gastrin also stimulates ECL cells to release histamine, which further amplifies acid secretion.',
  'Synergism: All three stimulants (ACh, histamine, gastrin) act synergistically on the parietal cell. Histamine is central — ACh and gastrin both stimulate ECL cells to release histamine, which then acts via the cAMP pathway. Blocking any one pathway (e.g., H2 blockers) reduces the effect of all three stimulants.',

  'Gastrin: secreted by G cells in the pyloric glands of the stomach antrum. Exists in two forms: G17 (17 amino acids, most abundant) and G34 (34 amino acids).',
  'Cephalic phase stimulation of gastrin (Central NS integration): The cephalic phase of gastric secretion occurs before food enters the stomach, triggered by sight, smell, thought, or taste of food. Neurogenic signals originate in the cerebral cortex and appetite centers of the amygdala and hypothalamus; transmitted through the dorsal motor nuclei of the vagi and via the vagus nerves to the stomach. Accounts for approximately 30% of gastric secretion associated with eating a meal.',
  'GRP (Gastrin-Releasing Peptide): a neuropeptide released by vagal nerve fibers (GRP-ergic neurons) in the gastric wall. GRP directly activates G cells, stimulating gastrin secretion — unlike ACh, GRP does not act on muscarinic receptors. GRP plays a significant role during the cephalic phase of digestion. (GRP = Bombesin in animal physiology.)',
  'Gastric phase stimulation (Enteral NS + gastric contents): Food enters the stomach → excites (1) long vagovagal reflexes from stomach to brain and back; (2) local enteric reflexes; and (3) the gastrin mechanism. Gastric phase accounts for ~60% of total gastric secretion. Stimuli for gastrin release: (a) Distention of the stomach — mechanoreceptors activate vagal reflexes stimulating G cells. (b) Presence of protein breakdown products (peptides and amino acids, especially phenylalanine and tryptophan) — directly stimulate G cells. (c) Rising pH (buffering by food) — removes the pH-dependent inhibition of gastrin release.',
  'Intestinal phase: Presence of partially digested food in the upper small intestine causes continued gastric secretion of small amounts of gastric juice, partly via intestinal gastrin (G34) released by duodenal mucosa. This accounts for approximately 10% of the acid response to a meal.',
  'Somatostatin — inhibitory regulation: Secreted by D cells in the gastric antrum (and body) in response to low pH (high acidity, pH <3) in the stomach. Two mechanisms of inhibition: (1) Paracrine inhibition — diffuses locally to G cells, binds somatostatin receptors, inhibits gastrin release; (2) also directly inhibits parietal cells and inhibits histamine release from ECL cells, reducing acid secretion. Negative feedback loop: low pH → D cell secretes somatostatin → inhibits G cells → less gastrin → less HCl. The vagus nerve inhibits D cells (via ACh at M3 receptor), reducing somatostatin secretion when food is present, thereby enhancing gastrin secretion.',

  'Neuronal mechanism — enterogastric reflex: When chyme enters the duodenum, mechanoreceptors, chemoreceptors, and osmoreceptors in the duodenal mucosa detect excessive distension, high acidity (low pH), hyperosmotic or hypo-osmotic chyme, protein and fat digestion products, and irritation of the duodenal mucosa. Pathways: (1) ENS (enteric/myenteric plexus) inhibitory neurons reduce gastric motility and suppress parietal cell activity; (2) Sympathetic reflex — signals travel to the celiac ganglion, increasing sympathetic outflow that inhibits gastric secretion; (3) Vagal reflex modulation — inhibitory signals from duodenum reach the dorsal vagal complex (DVC) in the brainstem, shifting the vagus nerve to an inhibitory response.',
  'Hormonal mechanism — intestinal inhibition: Secretin: released from S cells in the duodenum in response to acidic chyme (pH <4.5); inhibits parietal cells (reduces HCl secretion) and G cells (reduces gastrin release); stimulates pancreatic HCO₃⁻ secretion to neutralize acidity. Cholecystokinin (CCK): secreted by I cells in duodenum in response to fatty acids and protein digestion products; slows gastric emptying by inhibiting gastric motility and tightening the pyloric sphincter; indirectly reduces gastric acid secretion by inhibiting gastrin release. Gastric Inhibitory Peptide (GIP, also called Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Peptide): released by K cells in response to carbohydrates and fats in the duodenum; has a mild inhibitory effect on gastric acid secretion; stimulates insulin secretion. Somatostatin: secreted by D cells in stomach and duodenum in response to low pH; directly inhibits gastrin release from G cells and suppresses parietal cell activity.',

  'Overview: The entire surface of the stomach mucosa between glands has a continuous layer of a special type of mucous cells called "surface mucous cells." They secrete large quantities of viscid mucus that coats the stomach mucosa with a gel layer of mucus often more than 1 millimeter thick, thus providing a major shell of protection for the stomach wall, as well as contributing to lubrication of food transport. Another characteristic of this mucus is that it is alkaline. Therefore, the normal underlying stomach wall is not directly exposed to the highly acidic, proteolytic stomach secretion.',
  'Mucosal Barrier (Physical Protection): Mucus Secretion — surface mucous cells and mucous neck cells secrete a thick layer of viscid mucus that forms a gel-like coating (>1 mm) over the gastric epithelium; this mucus layer physically separates the epithelial cells from gastric acid and digestive enzymes. Mucus composition: water (95%), electrolytes (sodium, potassium), phospholipids, mucin proteins (most important — increases viscosity and forms the thick mucosal barrier). Tight Junctions — epithelial cells are tightly connected by tight junctions, preventing back-diffusion of H⁺ ions and stopping acid from penetrating the gastric mucosa.',
  'Chemical Protection: Bicarbonate (HCO₃⁻) Secretion — surface mucous cells secrete alkaline bicarbonate which gets trapped within the mucus layer; if any H⁺ penetrates the mucus, it is neutralized by HCO₃⁻ (H⁺ + HCO₃⁻ → H₂CO₃ → CO₂ + H₂O) before reaching epithelial cells; ensures the immediate environment of the epithelium remains near-neutral pH even though gastric lumen pH is 1–2. Prostaglandins (PGE₂): stimulate HCO₃⁻ and mucus secretion, enhance mucosal blood flow, and inhibit excessive H⁺ secretion from parietal cells. NSAIDs inhibit prostaglandin synthesis, which can lead to gastric ulcers.',
  'Cellular Protection and Repair: Epithelial Cell Renewal — gastric epithelium has a high turnover rate, with cells being replaced every 3–7 days; helps quickly repair minor damage before it leads to ulcers. Mucosal Blood Flow — adequate blood flow provides essential nutrients and oxygen, supporting rapid repair; removes back-diffused acid, preventing excessive H⁺ accumulation.',
  'Factors that impair the mucosal barrier and may result in ulcer or perforation: Vasoconstriction, Glucocorticoids, Salicylic acid (aspirin), Ethyl alcohol, Helicobacter pylori. Inhibition of PGE₂ synthesis impairs the mucosal barrier.',

  'Gastric pH significance: highly acidic due to HCl secreted by parietal cells; essential for protein digestion (activation of pepsinogen to pepsin) and killing pathogens. Esophageal pH significance: the esophagus is normally exposed to minimal acid, maintaining a pH above 4.0; acid reflux (GERD) is characterized by frequent pH drops below 4.0.',
  'Determination — 24-hour pH monitoring (ambulatory pH testing): A thin catheter with a pH sensor is inserted through the nose and positioned with the sensor above the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The catheter is connected to a portable recorder that logs pH data continuously over 24 hours. The patient goes about their normal activities and notes symptoms (e.g., heartburn) and mealtimes. The data is later analyzed to see how often and how long the pH drops below 4, indicating acid reflux.',
