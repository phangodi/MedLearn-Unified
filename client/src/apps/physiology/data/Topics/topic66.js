        'Enterohepatic circulation overview: Enterohepatic circulation is the recycling system of bile salts and bile acids between the liver, intestine, and blood. It plays a crucial role in conserving bile components and regulating lipid digestion. Bile acids are produced in the liver, secreted in the biliary system, transported to the intestine, metabolized by bacteria located there to secondary bile salts, and the secondary bile acids are transported back to the liver via the portal circulation.',
        'Step 1 - Liver synthesis and secretion: The liver synthesizes primary bile acids (cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid) from cholesterol. These are then conjugated with glycine or taurine, forming bile salts (e.g., taurocholate), which are secreted into bile via the bile salt export pump (BSEP) into bile canaliculi, stored in the gallbladder, and released into the duodenum during meals.',
        'Step 2 - Intestinal transformation to secondary bile acids: In the intestine, gut bacteria deconjugate and dehydroxylate primary bile salts using 7-α-dehydroxylase to form secondary bile acids: Cholic acid → Deoxycholic acid; Chenodeoxycholic acid → Lithocholic acid. Secondary bile acids are less water-soluble but still reabsorbed and reused. Secondary bile acids can also conjugate with glycine and taurine.',
        'Step 3 - Reabsorption: About 95% of bile salts are actively reabsorbed in the terminal ileum by ASBT. A small portion is passively absorbed in the colon or excreted in feces.',
        'Step 4 - Return to liver: Reabsorbed bile salts travel via the portal vein back to the liver, where they are taken up by NTCP (sodium-dependent) and OATP transporters and re-secreted into bile.',
        'Rate-limiting step: The hydroxylation by 7-α-hydroxylase (CYP7E1) is the rate-limiting step - slowest and one of the most important steps. High levels of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid allosterically regulate (inhibit) that enzyme.',
        'Different handling - primary vs. secondary: Primary bile salts are synthesized de novo and efficiently reabsorbed. Secondary bile acids (formed by bacterial action) are more hydrophobic and less efficiently reabsorbed, with lithocholic acid being largely excreted to prevent toxicity. Primary and secondary bile acids are both reabsorbed; the liver secretes both forms.'
