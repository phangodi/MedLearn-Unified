  'Cardiac muscle length: 100-150 µm. Skeletal muscle length: up to 20 cm (M. sartorius).',
  'Cardiac muscle fibers: smaller in diameter compared to skeletal muscle fibers. Branched fibers creating a network that supports coordinated contractions.',
  'Skeletal muscle fibers: larger in diameter and can vary significantly in length. Unbranched fibers that are long, cylindrical, and not branched, allowing for linear contraction along the length of the fiber.',
  'Cardiac muscle nucleus: one central nucleus. Skeletal muscle nucleus: many, on the periphery.',
  'Electrical connections in cardiac muscle: cardiac muscle cells are connected by intercalated discs, which contain gap junctions and desmosomes. Gap junctions allow ions to pass directly between cells, facilitating rapid electrical signaling and synchronized contraction (functional syncytium).',
  'Electrical connections in skeletal muscle: no electrical connections. Skeletal muscle fibers are electrically isolated from each other. Each fiber is innervated by a motor neuron at the neuromuscular junction, and contraction is initiated individually without direct electrical coupling between adjacent fibers.',
  'Intercalated discs: dark lines crossing the cardiac muscle fibers. These discs are cell membranes that separate individual muscle cells but also link them in series and parallel, ensuring connectivity.',
  'Cardiac muscle fiber structure: sarcomers (~ 2 μm). 30-60 sarcomers covered with sarcolemma = cardiac muscle fibre.',
  'Organization of contractile fibers: cardiac muscle parallel, in sarcomers. Skeletal muscle parallel, in sarcomers.',
  'Arrangement of myofilaments in cardiac muscle: striated appearance due to the organized arrangement of actin and myosin filaments in repeating units called sarcomeres. Although similar to skeletal muscle in the arrangement of myofilaments, cardiac muscle has shorter sarcomeres.',
  'Arrangement of myofilaments in skeletal muscle: striated appearance with actin and myosin arranged in a regular, repeating pattern of sarcomeres. Longer sarcomeres with arrangement of myofilaments tending to be more uniform, contributing to the powerful and voluntary contractions typical of skeletal muscle.',
  'Gap junctions structure: protein complexes called connexons, which form channels between adjacent cardiac muscle cells. Each connexon is made of six protein subunits called connexins. Gap junctions (connexon, 6 subunits, 2 nm space to pass ions).',
  'Gap junctions function: channels allow ions (e.g., sodium, calcium, potassium) and small molecules to pass directly from the cytoplasm of one cell to another.',
  'Ion permeability of gap junctions: high ion permeability enables the rapid movement of ions, facilitating the propagation of action potentials. This rapid ion transfer is essential for synchronizing the contraction of cardiac muscle cells.',
  'Electrical resistance of gap junctions: low-resistance pathway for electrical current to flow between cells. This low resistance allows action potentials to spread quickly across the myocardium. Because of the low electrical resistance, gap junctions enable all connected cells to depolarize almost simultaneously.',
  'Functional syncytium: the collective effect of rapid ion movement and low electrical resistance through gap junctions ensures that the heart muscle cells function as a single unit. This is known as a functional syncytium, where the atrial cells and ventricular cells contract as coordinated groups rather than as isolated individual cells. Longitudinal conduction is very fast. Gap junctions joined end-to-end. No transversal gap junctions.',
  'Propagation of action potentials: when an action potential is initiated in the pacemaker cells, it rapidly spreads through the myocardium via the gap junctions. This ensures that electrical impulses quickly reach all parts of the heart muscle, enabling synchronized contraction and efficient pumping of blood.'

  'Cardiac muscle action potential duration: much longer, typically lasting between 200-300 milliseconds. This prolonged action potential is due to the plateau phase, where calcium ions (Ca²⁺) enter the cell and maintain depolarization. The extended duration ensures that cardiac muscle has a prolonged contraction, allowing for adequate blood ejection from the heart chambers.',
  'Skeletal muscle action potential duration: much shorter, typically lasting about 1-2 milliseconds. The rapid action potential in skeletal muscle is due to the quick depolarization and repolarization phases without a plateau phase. The shorter duration allows for rapid, repeated contractions (twitches) needed for various voluntary movements.',
  'Cardiac muscle refractory period: long, nearly matching the duration of the action potential (200-300 milliseconds). This extended refractory period prevents the initiation of another action potential during the contraction, which ensures that the heart muscle fully relaxes before the next contraction. This prevents tetany (sustained contraction), allowing the heart chambers to refill with blood before the next heartbeat and maintaining proper rhythmic contractions.',
  'Skeletal muscle refractory period: much shorter, lasting only 1-2 milliseconds. The short refractory period allows for rapid successive action potentials, leading to the possibility of summation and tetany if the stimuli are frequent enough. This feature is necessary for skeletal muscle to perform sustained contractions required for activities such as holding a posture or lifting an object.',
  'Absolute Refractory Period (ARP): during the ARP, the ventricular cell cannot fire another action potential regardless of the strength of the stimulus. This is because the sodium (Na+) channels are inactive and closed, preventing inward current. This period spans the upstroke, entire plateau, and part of repolarization.',
  'Effective Refractory Period (ERP): slightly longer than the ARP.',
  'Temporal relationship in cardiac muscle: the action potential in cardiac muscle is characterized by a plateau phase that extends its duration. The action potential duration lasts almost as long as the muscle contraction itself. The refractory period overlaps with the entire duration of the action potential. Since the action potential overlaps with the contraction phase (muscle twitch), the cardiac muscle cannot be re-stimulated to generate another action potential until the current one is completed.',
  'Prevention of tetanus in cardiac muscle: the overlap of the refractory period with the contraction phase ensures that cardiac muscle cells cannot be re-excited until they have completed one full cycle of contraction and relaxation. This prevents the cardiac muscle from being stimulated at a high frequency that could result in tetanic contractions (sustained contraction without relaxation). In contrast, skeletal muscle, with a shorter refractory period and action potential, can be re-stimulated quickly, allowing for tetanus if repeatedly activated.',
  'Importance for cardiac function: this mechanism is critical for the heart to pump blood effectively. The heart must contract and then relax to fill with blood before the next contraction. If cardiac muscle could enter tetanus, the heart would remain in a contracted state, preventing blood flow and leading to life-threatening consequences. The extended refractory period allows time for the heart chambers to refill with blood and coordinate the next contraction for a consistent and efficient heartbeat.'

  'Step 1 - Action Potential Generation: an action potential is initiated in the cardiac muscle cell membrane (sarcolemma) and spreads rapidly across the cell.',
  'Step 2 - Calcium Influx via Voltage-Gated Channels: the depolarization caused by the action potential triggers the opening of L-type (long-lasting) voltage-gated calcium channels in the sarcolemma, allowing extracellular calcium ions to enter the cell.',
  'Step 3 - Calcium-Induced Calcium Release (CICR): the small influx of calcium into the cell stimulates the ryanodine receptors (RyR) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane, which causes a larger release of stored calcium ions from the SR into the cytoplasm.',
  'Step 4 - Increase in Intracellular Calcium Concentration: the combined influx of calcium from both the extracellular space and the SR significantly increases the cytoplasmic calcium concentration.',
  'Step 5 - Calcium Binding to Troponin: calcium binds to troponin C, a component of the troponin complex on the thin (actin) filaments. This causes a conformational change in the troponin complex, shifting tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin.',
  'Step 6 - Cross-Bridge Cycling: with the myosin-binding sites exposed, the myosin heads bind to actin, initiating the cross-bridge cycle. This cycle includes the steps of myosin attaching, pulling (power stroke), releasing, and resetting. ATP is required for myosin to detach from actin and reset for another contraction cycle.',
  'Step 7 - Contraction: the cross-bridge cycle results in the sliding of the actin filaments over the myosin filaments, causing the muscle cell to contract and generate force.',
  'Step 8 - Calcium Reuptake and Removal: to relax the muscle, calcium ions are pumped back into the SR by the SR Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) pump. Some calcium is also removed from the cell via the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) and the sarcolemma Ca²⁺-ATPase pump.',
  'Step 9 - Decrease in Intracellular Calcium: the reduction in cytoplasmic calcium concentration leads to the detachment of calcium from troponin. This allows tropomyosin to cover the myosin-binding sites on actin again, stopping the cross-bridge cycle.',
  'Step 10 - Relaxation: the cardiac muscle cell returns to its resting state, ready for the next action potential and contraction.',
  'Sources of intracellular Ca²⁺ increase - Extracellular Calcium Influx: during the plateau phase of the cardiac action potential, L-type calcium channels in the sarcolemma (cell membrane) open, allowing Ca²⁺ ions to flow into the cell from the extracellular space. This initial influx of calcium is relatively small but is critical for triggering further calcium release from internal stores.',
  'Sources of intracellular Ca²⁺ increase - Calcium-Induced Calcium Release (CICR): the small amount of Ca²⁺ entering the cell through the L-type channels binds to ryanodine receptors (RyR) on the SR membrane. This binding causes the RyR to open, resulting in a much larger release of stored Ca²⁺ from the SR into the cytoplasm. This release greatly amplifies the cytosolic calcium concentration and drives contraction.',
  'Special role of Ca²⁺ in modulation of contraction force - Troponin Binding: Ca²⁺ binds to troponin C (a part of the troponin complex) on the thin actin filaments. This binding induces a conformational change in the troponin complex, leading to the movement of tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin, facilitating cross-bridge formation between actin and myosin.',
  'Special role of Ca²⁺ in modulation of contraction force - Force Modulation: the amount of Ca²⁺ released from the SR directly affects the number of active cross-bridges between actin and myosin, modulating the force of contraction. A higher Ca²⁺ concentration results in more binding to troponin C, increasing the number of cross-bridges and thereby enhancing the contractile force.',
  'Special role of Ca²⁺ in modulation of contraction force - Sympathetic Stimulation: increased sympathetic activity enhances Ca²⁺ influx through the L-type channels and stimulates the release from the SR, leading to a stronger contraction (positive inotropic effect). This is mediated by β-adrenergic signaling and the phosphorylation of L-type channels and RyR by protein kinase A (PKA).',
  'Role of Ca²⁺ in Relaxation - Reuptake into the Sarcoplasmic Reticulum: the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) pump actively transports Ca²⁺ back into the SR. This reuptake process is essential for lowering cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels, allowing relaxation to occur. The activity of SERCA is regulated by phospholamban, a regulatory protein that, when unphosphorylated, inhibits SERCA. Phosphorylation of phospholamban (e.g., during sympathetic stimulation) enhances SERCA activity, accelerating relaxation (positive lusitropic effect).',
  'Role of Ca²⁺ in Relaxation - Extrusion from the Cell: a portion of Ca²⁺ is removed from the cytoplasm via the NCX, which operates using the sodium gradient to extrude Ca²⁺ from the cell. Sarcolemma Ca²⁺-ATPase: a minor pathway that helps pump Ca²⁺ out of the cell.',
  'Role of Ca²⁺ in Relaxation - Relaxation: the decrease in cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ concentration causes Ca²⁺ to dissociate from troponin C, which leads to tropomyosin re-blocking the myosin-binding sites on actin. This halts cross-bridge cycling and allows the muscle fibers to relax.'

  'Increasing the Length of Muscle Fibers (Heterometric Control) - Frank-Starling Mechanism: the heart has an intrinsic ability to increase its force of contraction in response to an increase in the volume of blood filling the heart (end-diastolic volume). This is known as the Frank-Starling law of the heart.',
  'Increasing the Length of Muscle Fibers (Heterometric Control) - Length-Tension Relationship: when cardiac muscle fibers are stretched (due to increased venous return and higher end-diastolic volume), the sarcomeres reach an optimal length (approximately 2.2 μm) for maximal cross-bridge formation between actin and myosin filaments. At this optimal length, the overlap between actin and myosin is ideal, allowing for an increased number of cross-bridges to form during contraction. This enhances the force of contraction.',
  'Increasing the Length of Muscle Fibers (Heterometric Control) - Mechanistic Basis - Increased Sensitivity to Ca²⁺: stretching the muscle fibers increases the sensitivity of the contractile proteins (troponin C) to Ca²⁺, meaning that for a given intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration, a stronger contraction occurs. Improved Sarcoplasmic Reticulum (SR) Function: the stretch of cardiac muscle fibers may also enhance the uptake and release of Ca²⁺ from the SR during excitation-contraction coupling, thereby contributing to greater inotropy.',
  'Frank-Starling law statement: the force of contraction of the cardiac muscle is directly proportional to the initial length of the muscle fibers (i.e., the degree of stretch) at the end of diastole. In other words, within physiological limits, the more the heart muscle is stretched during filling (greater preload), the stronger the force of contraction and the greater the volume of blood ejected (stroke volume). When the heart receives more blood during diastole (increased preload), the myocardial fibers are stretched, leading to optimal overlap of actin and myosin filaments. This results in a stronger contraction during systole. This intrinsic property ensures that the heart can match its output to the volume of blood returned to it, maintaining equilibrium between the input and output of the heart.',
  'Partial Inhibition of the Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase - Role of Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase: this enzyme actively pumps 3 Na⁺ out of the cell and 2 K⁺ into the cell, maintaining the electrochemical gradient across the cardiac cell membrane.',
  'Partial Inhibition of the Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase - Effect of Partial Inhibition - Na⁺ Accumulation: partial inhibition of Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase (e.g., by cardiac glycosides such as digoxin) leads to an increase in intracellular Na⁺ concentration.',
  'Partial Inhibition of the Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase - Effect of Partial Inhibition - Na⁺-Ca²⁺ Exchange Alteration: the increased intracellular Na⁺ reduces the activity of the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCX), which typically functions to extrude Ca²⁺ from the cell in exchange for Na⁺.',
  'Partial Inhibition of the Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase - Effect of Partial Inhibition - Resulting Ca²⁺ Accumulation: as the NCX is less effective at removing Ca²⁺ from the cell due to the reduced Na⁺ gradient, intracellular Ca²⁺ levels rise.',
  'Partial Inhibition of the Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase - Impact on Contraction: the elevated intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration leads to more Ca²⁺ being stored in the SR. During subsequent depolarization events, more Ca²⁺ is released from the SR, which enhances the binding of Ca²⁺ to troponin C and increases the power of contraction.',
  'Partial Inhibition of the Na⁺-K⁺-ATPase - Therapeutic Use: the major therapeutic use of cardiac glycosides is in the treatment of congestive heart failure, a condition characterized by decreased contractility of ventricular muscle (i.e., negative inotropism). When the failure occurs on the left side of the heart, the left ventricle is unable to develop normal tension when it contracts and is unable to eject a normal stroke volume into the aorta.',
  'Increasing Extracellular Ca²⁺ - Mechanism: in cardiac muscle, Ca²⁺ influx through L-type Ca²⁺ channels during the action potential is the trigger for SR Ca²⁺ release (CICR). Higher extracellular Ca²⁺ leads to: greater Ca²⁺ entry during depolarization, more Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release from the SR, and this results in more Ca²⁺ available for binding to troponin C.',
  'Increasing Extracellular Ca²⁺ - Result: greater force of contraction (positive inotropy). Inotropy Type: Homeometric (Ca²⁺-dependent). Relevance: seen physiologically with sympathetic stimulation, or pathologically in hypercalcemia.'

  'Positive lusitropic effect: refers to the increased rate of cardiac muscle relaxation. This effect is essential for the heart to properly fill with blood during diastole (the relaxation phase) and maintain adequate cardiac output. When the adrenergic receptors are stimulated, particularly the β1-adrenergic receptors in the heart, it induces several changes that enhance the relaxation phase of cardiac muscle contraction.',
  'Adrenergic Stimulation: stimulation of β1-adrenergic receptors occurs when catecholamines like epinephrine or norepinephrine bind to these receptors on the cardiac muscle cells. This binding activates the adenylyl cyclase enzyme, which converts ATP to cyclic AMP (cAMP).',
  'Increased cAMP Levels: cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which phosphorylates several target proteins involved in cardiac muscle contraction and relaxation.',
  'Phosphorylation of Phospholamban: phospholamban is a regulatory protein that normally inhibits the sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) pump. PKA phosphorylates phospholamban, reducing its inhibitory effect on SERCA. As a result, SERCA can work more efficiently to pump calcium ions back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) more quickly during relaxation.',
  'Enhanced Calcium Reuptake: the faster reuptake of calcium ions into the SR allows for quicker reduction of cytoplasmic calcium levels, which accelerates muscle relaxation.',
  'Shortened Relaxation Time: with rapid calcium reuptake, the duration of diastole is optimized, and the heart muscle relaxes more quickly, enabling it to fill with blood more effectively between contractions.',
  'Improved Cardiac Function: this positive lusitropic effect ensures that the heart can maintain higher heart rates and increased cardiac output, especially during periods of stress or exercise, when faster relaxation and filling are crucial.'
