  'Dietary water intake: the normal daily dietary water intake ranges between 1.5 to 2 liters per day; this amount varies based on factors such as climate, physical activity, and individual hydration needs.',
  'Sources of water in the GIS - Dietary intake: drinking liquids (the primary source) and food (many foods contain significant amounts of water, e.g., fruits, vegetables, soups).',
  'Sources of water in the GIS - Endogenous secretions: the GIS secretes 6-8 L/day (secretion 7 L/day as listed in Gellért lecture) including saliva (1–1.5 L), gastric secretions (2 L), pancreatic juice (1–1.5 L), bile (0.5 L), and intestinal secretions (1–2 L). Basic functions of GIS: secretion 7-8 L/day (mucosal glands, salivary glands, liver, pancreas); absorption 8-9 L/day (macronutrients, vitamins, minerals, water).',
  'Water absorption: 90% of water is absorbed in the intestines, primarily in the small intestine; the colon absorbs additional water, facilitated by electrolyte transport, which creates an osmotic gradient.',

  'Trace elements: vital ions which food and our body contain in very small quantities (iron, iodine, fluorine, copper, manganese, zinc, selenium). Unlike minerals, found in a small amount; demand is difficult to determine.',
  'Biological/biochemical significance: act as cofactors for enzymes involved in biochemical reactions; contribute to the structural stability of proteins and nucleic acids; play a role in oxidative stress regulation as part of antioxidant defense mechanisms; facilitate electron transport and energy production in metabolic pathways; are involved in hormone synthesis and function.',
  'Iron (Fe): 3–5 g, found in hemoglobin, in the bone marrow, within the precursor cells of erythropoiesis, in the muscle tissue myoglobin, in the liver, in the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system. Essential for oxygen transport as a component of hemoglobin in red blood cells; part of myoglobin in muscle tissue, facilitating oxygen storage; plays a role in electron transport in the mitochondrial cytochrome system (ETC). Absorbed as divalent iron (Fe2+) in the duodenum and proximal jejunum; from animal-derived food as hem-iron by endocytosis, more efficient; ferroportin is inhibited by the protein hepcidin.',
  'Zinc (Zn): integral part of over 300 enzymes, including carbonic anhydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, and peptidases; plays a role in immune function, wound healing, and DNA synthesis; essential for cell growth, division, and reproductive health. Slightly increased intake: positive effect on the immune system; excessively increased intake: free radical production, inhibits copper absorption.',
  'Copper (Cu): component of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD); required for red blood cell formation and iron metabolism; helps maintain healthy blood vessels, nerves, and immune function. Copper interferes with zinc absorption; Wilson\'s disease (excess copper).',
  'Selenium (Se): integral component of glutathione peroxidase, an enzyme that protects against oxidative stress; supports thyroid hormone metabolism; plays a role in immune function. Slightly increased intake: positive effect on the immune system.',
  'Iodine (I): essential for the synthesis of thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (T4) in the thyroid epithelial cells (thyrocytes). The iodized table salt contains a mixture of sodium iodate (NaIO3) and potassium iodate (KIO3); in the digestive tract iodates are reduced to iodide anions (I−) and absorbed by a sodium/iodide symporter. An important source of iodine: consumption of marine fish; daily iodine loss is about 5–15 µg through the stool and 120–180 µg through the urine.',
  'Fluorine (F): strengthens tooth enamel and prevents dental cavities; supports bone mineralization.',

  'Vitamins: vital organic molecules that the body cannot produce in sufficient quantities; they are important because of their biological effect (coenzymes) but not because of their energy content. Vitamins are organic compounds required in small amounts for normal metabolism; they serve as coenzymes, antioxidants, or precursors for hormones and play essential roles in physiological functions such as growth, immune response, and cellular repair. Unlike macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins), vitamins do not provide energy but are critical for enzyme function and biochemical reactions. The human body either cannot synthesize vitamins or produces them in insufficient amounts, necessitating dietary intake.',
  'Major classes of vitamins: classified into two major groups based on their solubility. Water-soluble vitamins (excreted via the kidneys, not stored significantly): B-complex vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B12) and vitamin C (ascorbic acid). Fat-soluble vitamins (absorbed with dietary fats, stored in body fat and liver): vitamin A (retinol), vitamin D (cholecalciferol/calciol), vitamin E (tocopherol), vitamin K (phylloquinone/menaquinone).',
  'Provitamins: inactive precursors that the body converts into active vitamins; these precursors serve as a dietary source for essential vitamins. Examples: β-carotene → retinol (vitamin A); 7-dehydrocholesterol → cholecalciferol (vitamin D3); tryptophan → niacin (vitamin B3).',
  'Antivitamins: prevent vitamin synthesis/vitamin action/resorption/vitamin coenzymes. They are compounds that inhibit the biological function of vitamins by either competing for binding sites, blocking absorption, or interfering with metabolic processes. Examples in medical use: Dicumarol and Warfarin (vitamin K antagonists, used as anticoagulants); Methotrexate (folic acid/vitamin B9 antagonist, used in cancer therapy); Cycloserin (binds vitamin B6); Isoniazid (antagonist of vitamin B6/pyridoxine, used in tuberculosis treatment); Avidin (found in raw egg whites, complexation with biotin, prevents absorption); Alcohol abuse (inhibits vitamin B1 resorption).',

  'Hypovitaminosis (vitamin deficiency), also known as avitaminosis: a condition caused by chronic or long-term vitamin deficiency; it results in impaired physiological and metabolic functions, which can lead to restricted physical and mental performance. High-metabolism tissues (myocardium, nervous system, immune system) and mitotic active tissues (skin, mucous membranes, epithelial cells, bone marrow) are particularly vulnerable. Causes: decreased intake, malabsorption, increased demand (growth, pregnancy, lactation), special conditions (gut flora damage, lack of prophylaxis).',
  'Hypervitaminosis (vitamin toxicity): results from excessive intake of certain vitamins, particularly fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K), which are stored in body tissues and accumulate to toxic levels. Need for vitamins: toxic vitamin intake (possibly death) in the case of fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamin A excess: headache, anorexia, irritability, liver and spleen enlargement (hepatosplenomegaly), skin inflammation, hair loss, bone pain and diarrhea. Hypervitaminosis D: tissue calcification, kidney failure and weight loss. Hypervitaminosis K: disorders in the gastrointestinal tract. Hypervitaminosis B6: disorders of peripheral nerve function. Three levels of toxicity: Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL), No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL), Lowest Observed Adverse Effect Level (LOAEL).',
  'Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA): the amount of a vitamin required to maintain normal metabolism and prevent deficiencies. Prevents metabolic disorders caused by both deficiency and excess. Varies based on individual factors such as age, gender, body size, physical activity, pregnancy, and illness. Expressed in mg/day or µg/day depending on the vitamin. For fat-soluble vitamins: minimum fat content of the diet is necessary for absorption.',

  'Thiamin (Vitamin B1): RDA: 1–1.5 mg/day. Sources: animal-derived foods, mainly as thiamine diphosphate (e.g., in fish, meat, pork, untreated cereals); absorbed in the small intestine by a thiamine/H+ antiporter; vitamin B1 binds to plasma proteins, mainly albumin. Major biochemical roles: coenzyme in various cellular reactions — citrate cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, degradation of leucine, isoleucine and valine; decarboxylation cofactor (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex); important in carbohydrate metabolism and nerve conduction. Deficiency symptoms — Beriberi (malnutrition): mainly affects neurons and (cardio)myocytes; dry beriberi: pathological changes in the peripheral and central nervous system, neuropathies, paralysis, CNS symptoms (loss of performance, mood swings); wet beriberi: edema, consequence of heart failure — pulmonary edema, liver congestion.

  'Niacin (Vitamin B3): RDA: 15–25 mg/day. Sources: plant products (whole grains, fruits): nicotinic acid; meat and fish: nicotinamide; also liver; can be synthesized from tryptophan. Major biochemical roles: the niacin derivatives NAD+ and NADP+ are coenzymes involved in cellular dehydrogenase reactions; intermediate steps in synthesis of fatty acids and cholesterol require NADPH; NAD+ required in β-oxidation and in the citrate cycle; key role in ATP production, glycolysis, and fatty acid metabolism. Deficiency symptoms: Pellagra (in developing countries where maize was almost exclusively foodstuffs): inflammatory skin changes (dermatitis) accompanied by thickening and blistering; diarrhea; non-specific neurological symptoms (possibly dementia) — the "3 Ds": dermatitis, diarrhea, dementia. Overdose: clear vasodilatory effect, skin redness, itching and warmth (vasodilatory prostaglandin activation).',
  'Cyanocobalamin (Vitamin B12): RDA: 1.5–3 µg/day; the liver of adults can store the need for vitamin B12 for several years. Sources: found almost exclusively in animal-based food (liver, meat, eggs); produced by bacteria. Absorption: in the stomach, released by action of stomach acid and pepsin; parietal cells secrete intrinsic factor; cobalamin bound by intrinsic factor in the duodenum/jejunum; cobalamin and intrinsic factor absorbed in the terminal ileum by endocytosis involving megalin and cubiline. Major biochemical roles: coenzyme for homocysteine methylation (methionine synthesis/DNA synthesis); involved in reactions in which methyl groups are relocated; involved in beta-oxidation and protein metabolism (methylmalonyl-CoA mutase); primes folate for DNA synthesis. Deficiency symptoms: impaired DNA replication; pernicious anemia (megaloblastic/macrocytic hyperchromic anemia due to lack of intrinsic factor); funicular myelosis — loss of myelin sheaths in the spinal cord, movement disorders, demyelination of large nerve fibers leading to neurological symptoms (paresthesia, memory loss).

  'Lipid-soluble vitamins: include vitamin A, D, E, and K; absorbed along with dietary fats (via micelles) and stored in the liver and adipose tissue; for fat-soluble vitamins, minimum fat content of the diet is necessary.',
  'Vitamin A (Retinol): RDA: 0.8–1.1 mg/day. Sources: occurs exclusively in animal-derived foods (liver is particularly rich, Ito cells store vitamin A; fish oils, dairy products, eggs); plant-based diet can cover need via carotenoids — β-carotene (most important source, in carrots) acts as provitamin A, cleaved into retinal and further reduced to retinol; retinyl esters cleaved in small intestine, incorporated into micelles, absorbed into enterocytes, reesterified, released into lymphatic system as component of chylomicrons, taken up by hepatocytes. Biological significance: rhodopsin component; regulates epithelial growth and differentiation; active form retinoic acid acts via intracellular retinoic acid receptors (RAR); maintains epithelial cell integrity in skin and mucous membranes; antioxidant and immune function. Deficiency symptoms: night blindness (impaired rod function); xerophthalmia (dryness, keratinization, and corneal damage — keratomalacia); dry skin/hyperkeratosis; increased susceptibility to infections; in developing countries where poor populations eat mainly rice.',
  'Vitamin D (Calciol/Cholecalciferol): Sources: sunlight exposure (UV converts 7-dehydrocholesterol to vitamin D3 in skin — responsible for majority); occurs as vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) in mushrooms and plant foods and as vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) in animal products, especially fatty fish; fish oil. Absorption through food is of secondary importance. Synthesis: multi-step process beginning with cholecalciferol; in the liver hydroxylated to 25(OH)D3 (calcidiol); 1α-hydroxylation in the kidney induced by hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, or parathyroid hormone → active form 1,25(OH)2D3. Biological significance: increases Ca2+ and PO4− absorption in the intestine; regulates calcium and phosphate homeostasis; supports bone mineralization; non-classical effects on immune system, insulin secretion. Deficiency symptoms: Rickets (children — "English disease"): weaker bones, large quantities of osteoid without calcification, osteoclastic absorption of bone → bandy leg, pigeon breast, craniodeformity, dental abnormalities; plasma calcium and phosphate decrease. Osteomalacia (adults): loss of mineral bone substance, severe bone pain, bone fractures. 1,25(OH)2D3 deficiency in chronic kidney failure: hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, secondary hyperparathyroidism.',

  'Dietary fibers: a group of inert food components (not accessible to the body\'s own digestive enzymes), of plant origin. They are the edible parts of plants that cannot be digested or absorbed in the small intestine and pass to the large intestine intact. Include cellulose, polysaccharides, lignin (steroid-like molecule in the wall of plant cells). Vital ions: indigestible plant fibers (prebiotics) for the normal function of the colon. Recommended amount: 30–40 g/day.',
  'Sources of dietary fibers: grains (oats, amaranth, barley, quinoa, millet, buckwheat), fruits, vegetables, legumes; also beans, whole grains, brown rice, potatoes, popcorn.',
  'Types of dietary fibers: Soluble fibers — dissolve in water to form a gel-like substance; fermented by gut microbiota in the large intestine; produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and gases (hydrogen, methane, CO2); help regulate blood glucose levels, lower cholesterol, and support gut health; slow digestion. Insoluble fibers — do not dissolve in water and remain largely intact through the digestive tract; absorb water as they move through GI tract; add bulk to stool and help it pass more quickly through the intestines; promote regular bowel movements, prevent constipation.',
  'Biological role — gut motility: fibers enhance peristalsis, reducing constipation and risk of diverticulosis; stretching of the intestinal wall shortens passage time; cellulose broken down by intestinal bacteria (e.g., producing acetate), used for energy requirements; stimulate gastric juice secretion; in the small intestine, slow down the absorption of glucose and cholesterol; insoluble fibers speed up transit time, soluble fibers slow digestion.',
  'Effects on microbiota of the colon: prebiotic function — soluble fibers are fermented by colonic bacteria, promoting growth of beneficial bacteria (e.g., Bifidobacteria, Lactobacilli; Bifidobacteria, Lactobacillus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Enterococcus faecalis); they change the composition of the intestinal flora in favor of beneficial bacteria (Lactobacillus, Bifidus strains). Fermentation produces SCFAs (butyrate, acetate, propionate): provide energy to colon cells, lower inflammation, protect against colorectal cancer (immunomodulatory/anti-inflammatory effect against inflammatory bowel diseases, colon carcinoma). Gut flora also synthesizes vitamin B and vitamin K; metabolizes bile acids, sterols, and xenobiotics; facilitates absorption of dietary minerals (Mg); acts as barrier to pathogenic microorganisms; immunostimulant.',
  'Additional metabolic and cardiovascular benefits: lowers LDL cholesterol and regulates blood glucose; helps in weight management by increasing satiety (evokes feeling of satiety); reduces risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease.',
