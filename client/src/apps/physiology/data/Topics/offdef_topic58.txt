// **LO-1** (Topic-58) - Motor functions of the upper urinary tract
officialDefinitions: [
  'Upper urinary tract: consists of the renal pelvis, calyces, and ureters. Plays a crucial role in the transportation of urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Motor functions are primarily driven by peristaltic movements and involve the coordination of smooth muscle activity, neural regulation, and specialized structures.',
  'Urine flow from renal pelvis to bladder: Urine formed in the nephrons enters the minor calyces, flows into the major calyces, and then into the renal pelvis, which acts as a reservoir before urine is transported through the ureters to the bladder. This flow is facilitated by rhythmic peristaltic contractions of the smooth muscle.',
  'Pacemaker activity in renal pelvis and calyces: Specialized smooth muscle cells in the renal pelvis generate spontaneous action potentials, initiating rhythmic contractions. These pacemaker cells are located near the pelvi-ureteric junction. The action potentials spread to adjacent smooth muscle cells via gap junctions, coordinating contractions. Contractions propagate distally, moving urine into the ureters.',
  'Ureteral peristalsis: Ureteral smooth muscle exhibits intrinsic peristaltic waves, which propel urine toward the bladder. The peristalsis is unidirectional, preventing backflow of urine. Longitudinal and circular smooth muscle layers in the ureter wall alternately contract and relax to produce peristalsis. Longitudinal muscle shortens the ureteral segment. Circular muscle propels urine distally by constricting the lumen. Peristaltic waves occur at a frequency of 1–5 contractions per minute, depending on urine flow and hydration status.',
  'Neural control of upper urinary tract: Sympathetic nervous system inhibits peristalsis and reduces urine flow by relaxing the ureteral smooth muscle, mediated via α-adrenergic receptors. Parasympathetic nervous system enhances peristalsis by stimulating smooth muscle contraction, mediated via muscarinic receptors (primarily M2 and M3 receptors).',
  'Hormonal and local factors: Prostaglandins enhance peristalsis and ureteral smooth muscle contraction. Nitric oxide (NO) acts as a local relaxant of ureteral smooth muscle. Hydrostatic pressure: Increased pressure in the renal pelvis or ureter stimulates stronger peristaltic contractions.',
  'Intrinsic regulation: Smooth muscle in the ureters has myogenic properties. It responds to stretch by initiating contraction, independent of neural input. Ensures that urine flow continues even after denervation.',
  'Prevention of urine backflow - Ureterovesical junction (UVJ): The ureterovesical junction, where the ureters enter the bladder, functions as a one-way valve. Oblique entry of ureter: The ureters pass obliquely through the bladder wall, creating a flap-valve mechanism. During bladder filling or contraction, increased bladder pressure compresses the ureteral openings, preventing urine reflux.'

// **LO-2** (Topic-58) - Innervation of urinary bladder and urethral sphincters (CRITICAL)
officialDefinitions: [
  'Anatomy of the urinary bladder: Detrusor muscle is the thick muscularis layer making up the walls of the bladder. Internal urethral sphincter consists of muscles surrounding the bladder neck. External urethral sphincter is a component of the urogenital diaphragm, striated muscle located distally and inferiorly to the bladder neck.',
  'Nervous involvement in the micturition reflex - locations: Sacral region (S2-S4) of the spinal cord. Thoracolumbar (T11-L2) of the spinal cord. Pons (contains pontine storage center and pontine micturition center). Cerebral cortex.',
  'Visceral sensory innervation: Stretch receptors are located in the detrusor muscle and respond to stretch of the bladder. Afferent signals from the bladder travel via the pelvic nerves (parasympathetic afferents) to the sacral spinal cord (S2–S4). These transmit information about bladder fullness to the spinal cord and higher brain centers (e.g., the pontine micturition center, PMC).',
  'Sympathetic innervation (T11-L2): Hypogastric nerve releases norepinephrine to the detrusor muscle and internal urethral sphincter. Norepinephrine binds to β3 adrenergic receptors on the detrusor muscle → inhibits the receptor → causes K+ to leave the cells → detrusor muscle relaxes. Norepinephrine binds to α1 adrenergic receptor → activates receptor → stimulates internal urethral sphincter contraction → prevents urine from passing through the urethra.',
  'Parasympathetic innervation (S2-S4): Preganglionic neurons in the sacral spinal cord (S2–S4) send efferent signals via the pelvic nerve. Effect: Stimulates detrusor muscle contraction via muscarinic M3 receptors. Relaxes the internal urethral sphincter. When preganglionic motor neurons are stimulated, they release acetylcholine (ACh) to the detrusor muscle → binds to M3 receptors → stimulates Ca2+ influx → muscle contraction.',
  'Somatic motor innervation (S2-S4): Cell bodies of the anterior gray horn project the pudendal nerve, which is part of the somatic nervous system. Pudendal nerve releases ACh that binds on the nicotinic type 1 receptors on the external urethral sphincter → muscle contraction. Provides voluntary control of the external urethral sphincter.',
  'Pontine storage center (PSC): Located in the pons. Activated by cerebral cortex when bladder is empty. Sends descending fibers that stimulate preganglionic motor neurons (sympathetic) → increased impulses to the hypogastric nerve → further relaxation of the detrusor muscle and constriction of the internal urethral sphincter. Inhibits the preganglionic motor neurons that are part of the parasympathetic nerves in S2-S4.',
  'Pontine micturition center (PMC): Located in the brainstem. Integrates sensory input and coordinates the activation of motor pathways for bladder emptying. Signals from the PMC inhibit the somatic and sympathetic pathways while activating the parasympathetic pathway. During micturition, PMC sends axons to inhibit the thoracolumbar region.'

// **LO-3** (Topic-58) - Cystometrogram and receptive relaxation
officialDefinitions: [
  'Cystometrogram: A graph that plots intravesical pressure (y-axis) vs. bladder volume (x-axis). It shows how pressure inside the bladder changes as it is slowly filled with fluid. As the urine volume is increasing, the pressure within the bladder is increasing significantly. Due to the micturition reflexes, the pressure rises in a very steep slope, and these reflexes increase in magnitude and frequency as the volume is increasing more and more.',
  'Initial Phase – Receptive relaxation: Volume increases, but pressure remains nearly constant. This phase shows the bladder\'s ability to accommodate increasing volume without a rise in pressure. This is called receptive (or adaptive) relaxation, also known as compliance of the bladder. On the cystometrogram, receptive relaxation is the low-pressure flat portion at the beginning of the filling phase.',
  'Mechanisms of receptive relaxation: Passive mechanical stretching of the bladder wall. Activation of parasympathetic afferents does not yet trigger detrusor contraction. Smooth muscle (detrusor) displays viscoelastic properties and neural inhibition allows it to relax as it fills. Central inhibition (from the brain and spinal reflex arcs) prevents bladder contraction during filling. Gap junctions between smooth muscle cells ensure synchronized relaxation of the detrusor muscle during filling.',
  'Threshold Phase: Once a critical volume (~300–400 mL) is reached, pressure begins to rise. Sensory signals to the brain increase → awareness of bladder fullness. Stretch receptors are activated until the bladder reaches around 200 mL (usually where we start the desire to go to the bathroom). Most people start urinating when the bladder reaches about 400-500 mL.',
  'Micturition reflex activation (if not inhibited): Sharp rise in pressure. Caused by parasympathetic-mediated detrusor contraction if voiding is allowed.'

// **LO-4** (Topic-58) - Micturition reflex arc and uroflowmetry (CRITICAL)
officialDefinitions: [
  'Micturition reflex: A spinal reflex regulated by higher brain centers that controls bladder emptying. It involves a coordinated interaction between sensory (afferent) and motor (efferent) pathways, as well as autonomic and somatic systems.',
  'Afferent limb: Sensory receptors are mechanoreceptors in the bladder wall that sense stretch as the bladder fills with urine. Afferent signals from the bladder travel via the pelvic nerves (parasympathetic afferents) to the sacral spinal cord (S2–S4). Function: Transmit information about bladder fullness to the spinal cord and higher brain centers (e.g., the pontine micturition center, PMC).',
  'Central integration: Sensory signals are processed in the sacral spinal cord, initiating local reflex activity. Pontine Micturition Center (PMC) is located in the brainstem, integrates sensory input and coordinates the activation of motor pathways for bladder emptying. Signals from the PMC inhibit the somatic and sympathetic pathways while activating the parasympathetic pathway.',
  'Efferent limb - Parasympathetic pathway: Preganglionic neurons in the sacral spinal cord (S2–S4) send efferent signals via the pelvic nerve. Effect: Stimulates detrusor muscle contraction via muscarinic M3 receptors. Relaxes the internal urethral sphincter.',
  'Efferent limb - Sympathetic pathway: During micturition, sympathetic activity via the hypogastric nerve (T11–L2) is inhibited. Effect: Detrusor relaxation is reduced (β3-adrenergic receptors). Internal urethral sphincter relaxation occurs (α1-adrenergic receptors).',
  'Efferent limb - Somatic pathway: Motor neurons in the sacral spinal cord (S2–S4) send signals via the pudendal nerve. Effect: The external urethral sphincter (skeletal muscle) is voluntarily relaxed to initiate urination.',
  'Voluntary control of micturition: The cerebral cortex suppresses the micturition reflex until a socially appropriate time to void. When appropriate, cortical centers allow activation of the PMC to facilitate micturition. Voluntary relaxation of the external urethral sphincter occurs via inhibition of the pudendal nerve.',
  'Pathway during full bladder: Stretch receptors activate the sensory afferent neurons → send increased impulses in the posterior gray horn. Ascending fibers go straight up to the pons and cerebral cortex bypassing the thoracolumbar region. Cerebral cortex sends descending axons to stimulate the PMC and inhibit the PSC. PMC then sends axons to inhibit the thoracolumbar region. Result: Detrusor muscle contracts, internal and external urethral sphincter relax → urine pushed out of the body.',
  'Uroflowmetry: A non-invasive diagnostic test used to measure the rate of urine flow over time during micturition.',
  'Uroflowmetry parameters: Maximum Flow Rate (Qmax) is the peak rate of urine flow, normal Qmax in adults is 15–20 mL/sec. Average Flow Rate (Qavg) is the average rate of flow over the entire voiding period. Voided Volume (V) is total urine output during the test. Time to Maximum Flow is the time it takes to reach Qmax.',
  'Significance of uroflowmetry: Assessment of urinary obstruction - a reduced flow rate indicates obstruction in the urinary tract (e.g., benign prostatic hyperplasia, urethral stricture), Qmax < 10 mL/sec often suggests significant obstruction. Evaluation of bladder function - identifies detrusor underactivity or overactivity, helps assess the coordination between bladder contraction and sphincter relaxation. Diagnosis of urinary disorders - useful in evaluating urinary retention, incontinence, post-void residual. Treatment monitoring - tracks effectiveness of therapies for urinary obstruction (medications like alpha-blockers, surgical interventions like TURP).'

// **LO-5** (Topic-58) - Passive and active incontinence (CRITICAL)
officialDefinitions: [
  'Passive incontinence: Refers to the involuntary leakage of urine that occurs without the patient being aware of the urge to urinate. The leakage typically happens due to the loss of control over the urinary sphincters or because the bladder overfills and overcomes the sphincter\'s resistance.',
  'Passive incontinence causes: Neurological conditions such as spinal cord injuries, multiple sclerosis, or diabetic neuropathy leading to a loss of sensory input. Intrinsic sphincter deficiency characterized by weakness or dysfunction of the internal or external urethral sphincters. Overflow incontinence due to bladder overdistension from chronic urinary retention. Example conditions include overflow incontinence and neurogenic bladder dysfunction.',
  'Active incontinence: Refers to involuntary urine leakage that occurs when there is a sudden increase in intra-abdominal pressure, such as during physical activities like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercising. The patient is typically aware of the leakage but cannot prevent it.',
  'Active incontinence causes: Weakness of the pelvic floor muscles. Urethral hypermobility. Insufficient support to the bladder neck and urethra. Example conditions include stress urinary incontinence (SUI) with leakage due to increased intra-abdominal pressure, and pelvic organ prolapse affecting urethral closure.'
