        'Diastolic pressure curve (blue): created by filling the ventricle with increasing volumes of blood and measuring the end-diastolic pressure (EDP) before contraction. Up to approximately 150 mL, the pressure increases slowly, meaning the ventricle is compliant (can stretch easily). Above 150 mL, pressure rises sharply because the fibrous tissue and pericardium limit further stretch, making the ventricle become less compliant (stiffer). This part of the curve reflects passive tension in the ventricle.',
        'Systolic pressure curve (green): created by recording the peak systolic pressure during contraction at different levels of filling (volume). The ventricle generates higher pressure as volume increases up to an optimal point (150-170 mL) due to greater stretch leading to better overlap of actin and myosin filaments and stronger contraction (Frank-Starling law). Beyond 170 mL, pressure starts to fall because the muscle is overstretched and actin and myosin filaments cannot form strong cross-bridges, weakening contraction. This is the active tension part of the length-tension relationship.',
        'Clinical pressures: in a normal left ventricle, the maximum systolic pressure can range between 250-300 mmHg, depending on contractility and nervous system stimulation. In a normal right ventricle, the systolic pressure is much lower, typically 60-80 mmHg, because it pumps blood into the low-pressure pulmonary circulation.',
        'Sarcomere length ↔ End-diastolic volume (EDV): in the PV loop, the horizontal axis (ventricular volume) reflects sarcomere length at the start of contraction. As EDV increases (e.g., from 50 mL to 120 mL), the cardiac fibers are stretched more, increasing sarcomere length. This is directly linked to active tension according to the Frank-Starling law: increased length leads to increased cross-bridge overlap and increased contraction force.',
        'Passive tension ↔ Diastolic pressure curve (blue line): the blue diastolic pressure curve represents the pressure the ventricle develops before contraction as it is filled. This corresponds to passive tension at the cellular level: stretching the muscle increases resistance due to elastic components (like titin). A steeper blue curve indicates a stiffer ventricle (less compliant).',

This curve reflects the active tension produced by cross-bridge cycling in cardiac muscle fibers. It peaks at optimal volume (approximately 150-170 mL), and beyond this, tension and pressure decline because sarcomeres are overstretched, leading to reduced filament overlap.',
        'Velocity of shortening ↔ Rate of ejection: during ejection phase of the loop, the ventricle shortens while ejecting blood. Velocity of fiber shortening depends on afterload (aortic pressure) and contractility. When afterload is high, shortening slows; when contractility is high (e.g., via sympathetic stimulation), shortening is faster. This is reflected by dP/dtmax, the slope of pressure rise during isovolumetric contraction.',

        'Preload: the initial stretching of the cardiac muscle fibers at the end of diastole, just before the onset of systole. It is essentially the load or tension on the ventricular walls immediately before they contract. This stretching is influenced by the volume of blood filling the ventricles at the end of diastole, known as the end-diastolic volume (EDV). The greater the EDV, the higher the preload, which in turn influences the force of the subsequent contraction according to the Frank-Starling law.',
        'End-diastolic ventricular pressure (EDP): directly correlates with the stretch of the ventricular walls because it reflects the pressure within the ventricles when they are filled with blood at the end of diastole.

        'Atrial pressure: atrial pressure, particularly left atrial pressure for the left ventricle and right atrial pressure for the right ventricle, reflects the pressure that propels blood into the ventricles during diastole.

        'Central venous pressure (CVP): CVP is an estimate of the right atrial pressure and reflects the pressure within the venous system that returns blood to the heart. CVP reflects right atrial pressure, which determines right ventricular filling. CVP indicates the volume status of the venous return to the right side of the heart, which affects how much blood is available to fill the ventricles during diastole.',

This is crucial for accurately assessing the true load on the myocardium before contraction. The pressure in the ventricle at the end of diastole directly relates to the degree of myocardial fiber stretch, which determines the initial tension in the ventricular walls. Unlike atrial pressure and CVP, which can be influenced by other factors such as atrial compliance, respiratory changes, and venous return fluctuations, ventricular pressure reflects the conditions within the ventricles themselves, making it a more precise reflection of the actual preload on the cardiac muscle. EDP aligns with the principles of the Frank-Starling law, which states that the force of contraction is proportional to the initial fiber length (or preload). Accurately measuring this pressure helps in predicting the heart\'s response to changes in volume load and the resulting cardiac output.'

        'Adaptation to changes in preload: a transplanted, denervated heart lacks neural regulation and depends solely on intrinsic mechanisms to adapt to changes in preload and afterload. Preload refers to the volume of blood filling the ventricles at the end of diastole (end-diastolic volume). The Starling preparation can vary the volume of blood entering the heart, allowing researchers to observe how the heart responds. The Frank-Starling law states that the stroke volume of the heart increases in response to an increase in the volume of blood filling the heart (preload). This is because the increased stretch of the ventricular muscle fibers during diastole leads to stronger contractions during systole. In a denervated heart, this intrinsic property allows it to pump out more blood when preload increases, maintaining cardiac output without external regulation.',

The Starling heart-lung preparation can simulate increased afterload by adding resistance to the outflow tract. The heart responds by increasing contractile force to overcome the added resistance, although this mechanism is less pronounced compared to the response to changes in preload. This intrinsic ability allows a denervated heart to adapt to moderate changes in afterload by adjusting its contractility to maintain stroke volume and cardiac output.',

In other words, within physiological limits, the more the heart muscle is stretched during filling (greater preload), the stronger the force of contraction and the greater the volume of blood ejected (stroke volume). When the heart receives more blood during diastole (increased preload), the myocardial fibers are stretched, leading to optimal overlap of actin and myosin filaments. This results in a stronger contraction during systole.
