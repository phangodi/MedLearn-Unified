The amount of active tension is directly related to the number of actin and myosin cross-bridges that can be formed. This number, in turn, depends on the degree of overlap between the thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments.

          'Muscle Twitch is the basic unit of contraction in a muscle fiber and occurs in response to a single action potential. Phases of Muscle Twitch: Latent Period: The latent period is the brief time between the delivery of the stimulus to the muscle and the start of contraction. During this period, the action potential travels along the sarcolemma and down the T-tubules, triggering the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. No visible contraction occurs because the cross-bridge cycle has not yet begun. Contraction Phase: The contraction phase begins when calcium ions bind to troponin, causing a conformational change that moves tropomyosin away from the myosin-binding sites on actin. This allows the cross-bridge cycle to occur, where myosin heads bind to actin, pull the actin filaments towards the center of the sarcomere, and release to reattach in a ratcheting fashion, producing tension and shortening the muscle. Relaxation Phase: In the relaxation phase, calcium ions are actively pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. As calcium concentration in the cytosol decreases, calcium dissociates from troponin, causing tropomyosin to cover the binding sites on actin. The cross-bridge cycle ceases, and the muscle fiber returns to its resting state.',

Incomplete (Unfused) Tetanus: Occurs when a muscle fiber is stimulated at a frequency that allows partial relaxation between contractions. Each successive contraction is slightly stronger than the previous one, leading to a wavy, fluctuating tension on the tension-time graph. The resulting force is greater than that of individual twitches because the muscle does not completely relax, maintaining a higher level of calcium in the cytoplasm. Complete (Fused) Tetanus: Occurs when the frequency of stimulation is so high that no relaxation occurs between contractions. The muscle remains in a state of continuous contraction, with no decrease in force between stimuli. This results in a smooth, sustained contraction with maximal force, as all possible cross-bridges are engaged and maintained throughout the contraction.',

This incomplete relaxation results in the additive effect of force production from successive stimuli, known as contraction summation. The underlying mechanism involves the cumulative increase in intracellular calcium concentration, leading to sustained cross-bridge cycling. Mechanism of Contraction Summation: Each action potential releases a specific amount of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. With increased stimulation frequency, the time between action potentials is reduced, preventing complete reuptake of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. As a result, calcium ions accumulate in the cytosol, saturating troponin and maintaining actin-myosin interaction.
