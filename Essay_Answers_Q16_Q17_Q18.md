## Essay Question 16: The Comparison of Duchenne's and Becker's Type Muscle Dystrophies

*Reference: Slides 27-33/V*

### Introduction

Muscular dystrophies comprise a group of hereditary and non-hereditary muscle diseases that weaken the musculoskeletal system and impair locomotion. These disorders are characterized by progressive skeletal muscle weakness, defects in muscle proteins, and the death of muscle cells and tissue. The first descriptions of the most common and severe form came from a French neurologist, Guillaume Duchenne, leading to the naming of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD). While there are eight main types of dystrophies, the Duchenne type is by far the most prevalent. Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) represents a milder variant caused by mutations in the same gene.

### The Dystrophin Gene and Protein

The dystrophin gene is the largest known human gene, spanning 2.2 × 10⁶ base pairs and located on the X chromosome. The muscle-specific full transcript isoform is composed of 79 exons, and the gene utilizes several promoters to generate different isoforms. The large size of this gene may increase the risk of mutations, particularly deletions that disrupt splicing.

**Dystrophin Protein Structure and Function:**

Dystrophin is a cytoskeletal protein that serves as a critical link between the intracellular cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix. Through a protein complex, dystrophin couples the basal lamina (extracellular matrix) to the actin cytoskeleton. The dystrophin-associated protein complex includes several membrane proteins also involved in other types of dystrophies, such as dystroglycans, sarcoglycans, sarcospan, dystrobrevin, syntrophins, and neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS).

**Dystrophin Isoforms:**

The dystrophin gene produces multiple isoforms from different downstream promoters. The shorter isoforms retain the cysteine-rich and C-terminal domains, preserving binding sites for dystroglycan, dystrobrevin, and syntrophin, with variable extents of the spectrin-like repeats domain. They all lack the actin-binding N-terminus. Notably, the Dp140 and Dp71 isoforms have been associated with an increased risk of mental retardation, suggesting an important role for dystrophin in the central nervous system.

### Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD)

**Epidemiology and Inheritance:**

- Incidence: 1:3,000 live births
- Affects almost exclusively males
- X-linked recessive inheritance pattern
- Both sexes can theoretically be affected, but due to X-linkage and hemizygous insufficiency, males predominantly show symptoms while females are typically carriers

**Clinical Features:**

Symptoms may be visible in infancy but appear by age 5 at the latest. The clinical course is progressive and includes:

- Progressive proximal muscle weakness of the legs and pelvis, with loss of muscle mass first observed, later extending to arms, neck, and other areas
- Pseudohypertrophy: apparent enlargement of calf and deltoid muscles due to replacement with connective tissue and adipose tissue
- Low endurance and difficulties in standing unaided or inability to ascend staircases
- As the condition progresses, muscle tissue experiences wasting and is eventually replaced by fat and fibrotic tissue (fibrosis)
- By age 10, braces may be required for walking; most patients are wheelchair-dependent by age 12
- Affects all voluntary muscles and involves the heart and respiratory muscles in later stages
- Life expectancy typically ranges from the early teens to the mid-twenties

**Molecular Mechanism:**

DMD is caused by mRNA containing out-of-frame mutations (deletions, insertions, or splice site mutations), resulting in frameshift or early termination. This leads to the production of a shorter, non-functional dystrophin in most muscle fibers, although some revertant muscle fibers may produce some dystrophin.

**Pathogenesis:**

1. The absence of dystrophin permits excess calcium to penetrate the sarcolemma (cell membrane)
2. Alterations in signaling pathways cause water to enter the mitochondria, which then burst
3. Mitochondrial dysfunction gives rise to amplification of stress-induced cytosolic calcium signals and increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production
4. In a complex cascading process involving several incompletely understood pathways, increased oxidative stress within the cell damages the sarcolemma
5. This ultimately results in the necrotic death of muscle fibers
6. Muscle fibers are replaced with adipose and connective tissue
7. Muscle necrosis also leads to bone deformation, mainly in the spinal column

### Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD)

**Key Distinction from DMD:**

Patients with Becker's muscular dystrophy have a form of dystrophin that, although shorter than normal dystrophin, remains at least partially functional. This results in symptoms that are much milder than in DMD.

**Molecular Basis:**

In BMD, the mutations typically preserve the reading frame (in-frame deletions or mutations), allowing for the production of a truncated but partially functional dystrophin protein. This moderately shortened reading frame distinguishes BMD from DMD at the molecular level.

**Clinical Features:**

- Later onset of symptoms compared to DMD
- Slower disease progression
- Longer life expectancy
- Maintained ambulation for a longer period
- Variable severity depending on the specific mutation and how much dystrophin function is retained

### Therapeutic Approach: Exon Skipping

In many cases, an antisense oligonucleotide (AON) can be used therapeutically to trigger skipping of an adjacent exon to restore the reading frame and allow production of partially functional dystrophin. This approach essentially converts a severe DMD phenotype into a milder BMD-like phenotype.

**Mechanism of Exon Skipping:**

- **Normal splicing (A)**: Pre-mRNA contains all exons which are properly spliced to form mature mRNA, producing functional dystrophin
- **DMD splicing (B)**: Mutation (e.g., deletion of exon 50) causes frameshift, introducing a premature stop codon and resulting in no functional dystrophin
- **ODN therapy (C)**: Antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) binds to pre-mRNA and causes skipping of the exon containing or adjacent to the mutation. This produces shortened but in-frame mRNA, allowing production of altered dystrophin that is BMD-like in function

### Comparative Summary: DMD vs. BMD

| Feature | Duchenne (DMD) | Becker (BMD) |
|---------|----------------|--------------|
| **Severity** | Severe | Mild to moderate |
| **Mutation Type** | Out-of-frame (frameshift) | In-frame |
| **Dystrophin Protein** | Absent or non-functional | Shortened but partially functional |
| **Onset** | Before age 5 | Variable, often later |
| **Wheelchair Dependency** | By age 12 | Much later or never |
| **Life Expectancy** | Early teens to mid-twenties | Near normal to moderately reduced |
| **Muscle Function** | Rapidly progressive loss | Slowly progressive |

### Conclusion

Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies represent a spectrum of disease severity caused by mutations in the same gene. The critical distinction lies in whether the mutation disrupts the reading frame (DMD) or preserves it (BMD), determining whether any functional dystrophin can be produced. Understanding this molecular distinction has led to the development of exon skipping therapies that aim to convert the severe DMD phenotype to a milder BMD-like phenotype by restoring the reading frame, offering hope for improved outcomes in affected patients.

## Essay Question 17: The Characterization and Cause of Achondroplasia

*Reference: Slides 5-11/V*

### Introduction

Achondroplasia is the prototype of short-limbed dwarfism and the archetype of a group of disorders ranging from the much more severe thanatophoric dysplasia (TD) to the less severe hypochondroplasia. It represents approximately 70% of all genetic causes of dwarfism, making it the most common form.

### Definition of Dwarfism

Size disorders can be recognized in infancy or at the latest in childhood. Dwarfism is typically defined as an adult height of less than 147 cm (4 ft 10 in). However, low stature alone is not considered an abnormality unless associated with a condition that requires treatment. Dwarfism can be characterized by various physical parameters, such as trunk to limb length ratio and head to trunk length ratio, and can be either proportionate or disproportionate. There are up to 300 known genetic causes of dwarfism.

### Clinical Phenotype of Achondroplasia

Achondroplasia and related disorders share a common qualitative clinical phenotype characterized by:

- **Short limbs**: Limbs are disproportionately shorter than the trunk (abdominal region)
- **Long trunk**: The torso is relatively normal in length
- **Large head**: Macrocephaly is common
- **Frontal bossing**: Protruding broad forehead
- **Midfacial hypoplasia**: Underdevelopment of the middle face region
- **Average height**: Approximately 131 cm in males and 123 cm in females

Historical representations of achondroplasia can be seen in medieval artwork, including paintings by Velázquez.

### Epidemiology

- **Incidence**: Between 1:40,000 and 1:15,000 births
- **Inheritance pattern**: Autosomal dominant
- **Origin of mutations**: About 85% of cases are caused by sporadic (new) mutations
- **Paternal age association**: Sporadic cases are associated with paternal age over 35 years
- **Parental origin**: Studies have shown that new gene mutations for achondroplasia are exclusively inherited from the father, occurring during spermatogenesis
- **Possible selective advantage**: Research suggests the mutation may provide selective advantage to the spermatocyte

### Molecular Cause: FGFR3 Mutations

**The FGFR3 Gene:**

Achondroplasia is caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. The penetrance of the mutation is high, close to 100%.

**Specific Mutations:**

- 98% of all causing mutations are a G to A point mutation at nucleotide position 1138 of the FGFR3 gene
- 1% of cases involve a G to C transversion at the same position
- These mutations affect the transmembrane domain of the receptor

### Normal FGFR3 Function

Under normal conditions:

1. The ligand (FGF - fibroblast growth factor) induces dimerization of receptor monomers
2. This activates the receptor's intracellular kinase domain and initiates propagation of FGFR3 signals
3. Activated FGFR3 is targeted to and degraded by lysosomes relatively soon after activation
4. FGFR3 has a **negative regulatory effect on bone growth** by inhibiting cartilage growth

This negative regulatory function is crucial: FGFR3 normally acts as a brake on bone growth.

### Pathological Mechanism in Achondroplasia

In achondroplasia, the mutation leads to a **gain of function** of the FGFR3 receptor:

**Mechanism of FGFR3 Constitutive Activation:**

The mutation in the transmembrane domain of the receptor stabilizes FGFR3 dimers without the need for ligand binding. This results in:

1. **Constitutively active receptor**: The mutated form of FGFR3 is active even without ligand binding
2. **Prolonged signaling**: The stabilized dimers signal continuously
3. **Slowed lysosomal degradation**: In mutant conditions, the normal targeting to lysosomes is delayed
4. **Enhanced inhibition of bone growth**: Since FGFR3 normally inhibits cartilage and bone growth, constitutive activation leads to severely shortened bones

### Related Disorders with FGFR3 Mutations

Different mutations in FGFR3 lead to a spectrum of disorders:

**Thanatophoric Dysplasia Type I (TDI):**
- FGFR3 dimers are induced by formation of disulfide bonds in the proximal extracellular domain
- More severe than achondroplasia
- Usually lethal in the perinatal period

**Thanatophoric Dysplasia Type II (TDII) and SADDAN:**
- The kinase is constitutively activated by mutation in the kinase domain
- Very severe phenotype

**Hypochondroplasia:**
- Milder mutations in FGFR3
- Less severe phenotype than achondroplasia

In all pathological states (B-D), lysosomal degradation of the receptor is slowed, contributing to prolonged signaling.

### Homozygosity

When both parents have achondroplasia:

- The homozygous offspring will inherit two copies of the mutant FGFR3 gene
- This results in a **lethal** phenotype before or shortly after birth
- The excessive inhibition of bone and cartilage development is incompatible with survival

### Role of Lysosomes in FGFR3 Regulation

Lysosomes play a central role in regulating FGFR3 signaling. They are membrane-surrounded vesicles containing enzymes with acidic pH optima that function in:

- Secretion
- Autophagic digestion
- Digestion of internalized extracellular material

The normal rapid targeting of activated FGFR3 to lysosomes limits the duration of receptor signaling. When this process is slowed by mutations, as in achondroplasia and related disorders, the result is prolonged inhibitory signaling and impaired bone growth.

### Summary Table: FGFR3 Mutations and Associated Disorders

| Disorder | Mutation Location | Mechanism | Severity |
|----------|------------------|-----------|----------|
| **Achondroplasia** | Transmembrane domain | Stabilized dimers | Moderate |
| **Hypochondroplasia** | Kinase domain (partial) | Partial kinase activation | Mild |
| **TD Type I** | Extracellular domain | Disulfide-induced dimers | Severe (lethal) |
| **TD Type II/SADDAN** | Kinase domain | Constitutive kinase activation | Severe (lethal) |

### Conclusion

Achondroplasia is the most common form of genetic dwarfism, caused by gain-of-function mutations in the FGFR3 gene. The mutation leads to constitutive activation of the receptor, which normally inhibits bone growth. Because the mutant receptor signals continuously and is degraded more slowly than normal, bone and cartilage development is severely impaired, resulting in the characteristic short-limbed dwarfism. Understanding this molecular mechanism has important implications for potential therapeutic interventions targeting the FGFR3 signaling pathway.

## Essay Question 18: Hepcidin and Iron Metabolism

*Reference: Slides 13-18/VI*

### Introduction

Iron metabolism is closely related to the function of blood and is essential for numerous biological processes. Understanding iron homeostasis is critical for comprehending various pathological conditions, including anemias and iron overload disorders. Hepcidin, a peptide hormone discovered in 2000, has emerged as the master regulator of iron metabolism.

### Overview of Iron Metabolism

**Iron Distribution in the Body:**

The human body contains approximately 4 g of iron, distributed as follows:

- **Hemoglobin**: Slightly more than 2 g (approximately 1 mg per 1 ml of erythrocytes)
- **Body stores**: About 1 g, mainly in the liver
- **Other proteins**: The remainder in myoglobin and other proteins, including cytochrome P450 oxidases

**Iron Turnover:**

- Daily iron loss: 1-2 mg through epithelial shedding in the gastrointestinal tract, skin renewal, and menstruation in women
- **Critical point**: There is no physiological mechanism for excreting larger amounts of iron
- Western diets contain about 10-fold greater amounts of iron than what is absorbed daily (1-2 mg under normal circumstances)
- Absorption increases several-fold in iron deficiency and is partly suppressed when iron stores are excessive

### Iron Absorption and Transport

**Forms of Dietary Iron:**

Iron to be absorbed can be:
1. **Heme iron**: Part of a heme protein
2. **Non-heme iron**: In the ferrous (Fe²⁺) state

**Absorption Process:**

1. **Reduction**: A reductase enzyme on the enterocyte brush border, called **Dcytb** (duodenal cytochrome b), reduces ferric Fe³⁺ to ferrous Fe²⁺
2. **Uptake**: A protein called **divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1)** transports Fe²⁺ across the enterocyte's apical membrane into the cell
3. **Intracellular fate**: Intestinal epithelial cells can either:
   - Store iron as **ferritin** (Fe³⁺ form)
   - Export it into the body via **ferroportin**
4. **Plasma transport**: **Transferrin** transports iron (Fe³⁺) in the blood plasma to the cell surface **transferrin receptor**, where it is internalized

### Hepcidin: The Master Regulator

**Discovery and Structure:**

Hepcidin is a peptide hormone produced by the liver, discovered in 2000, and appears to be the master regulator of iron homeostasis.

**Molecular Forms:**

- **Preprohormone**: 84 amino acids
- **Prohormone**: 60 amino acids
- **Mature hormone**: 25 amino acids
- The N-terminal region is required for function

**Mechanism of Action:**

Hepcidin inhibits iron transport by binding to the iron channel **ferroportin** on:

1. The basolateral surface of gut enterocytes
2. The plasma membrane of reticuloendothelial cells (macrophages)

Upon hepcidin binding:

- Ferroportin is internalized and degraded
- Iron efflux to the hepatic portal system is decreased
- Iron remains trapped in enterocytes and macrophages

### Regulation of Hepcidin Synthesis

**Hepcidin Expression Stimulators (in the liver):**

- **HFE** (Human hemochromatosis protein)
- **Transferrin receptors** (TfR1, TfR2)
- **HJV** (Hemojuvelin) / soluble HJV

**Factors that INCREASE Hepcidin Synthesis:**

- Increased iron stores
- Inflammation (mediated by interleukins and TIR1/TIR2 - Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain proteins)
- Iron loading

**Factors that DECREASE Hepcidin Synthesis:**

- Hypoxia
- Anemia
- Increased erythropoiesis
- Ineffective erythropoiesis in the bone marrow

### Iron Distribution Cycle

**Quantitative Overview:**

- **Erythrocytes**: ~2500 mg iron
- **Bone marrow**: ~300 mg iron
- **Macrophages**: ~600 mg iron (from recycled RBCs)
- **Plasma Fe-Transferrin**: ~3 mg iron
- **Iron turnover**: 20-25 mg/day recycled through erythropoiesis

The recycling of iron from senescent red blood cells by macrophages provides most of the iron needed for new erythrocyte production, with only 1-2 mg/day absorbed from the diet to replace losses.

### Hepcidin in Pathological Conditions

Hepcidin levels correlate with the release of absorbed iron from intestinal enterocytes and play a role in the pathogenesis of:

#### 1. Anemia of Chronic Disease (Inflammation)

**Mechanism:**

- In chronic inflammatory states, hepcidin is **overexpressed**
- High hepcidin causes ferroportin internalization and degradation
- Iron accumulates in enterocytes and macrophages
- Low plasma iron levels result
- This leads to iron-restricted erythropoiesis and anemia

**Biological Rationale:**

Iron plays an important role in host defense responses to infectious agents. Several host defense proteins function to sequester iron from invading microorganisms:

- **Lactoferrin**
- **Siderocalin** (also called neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, lipocalin 2, or NGAL)
- **NRAMP2** (natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 2)

On a systemic level, hypoferremia (low serum iron) develops early during infection and, if prolonged, eventually leads to the characteristic anemia of inflammation.

#### 2. Hemochromatosis (Iron Overload)

**Mechanism:**

- Hepcidin is **deficient or low**
- Without hepcidin inhibition, ferroportin remains active
- Excessive iron is released from enterocytes into plasma
- Iron overload develops in tissues
- Overloaded plasma iron levels damage organs

**Juvenile Hemochromatosis (JH):**

Iron overload can cause potentially fatal iron intoxication at a young age, first affecting the liver and heart.

- Only a few JH patients carry mutations in the hepcidin gene itself
- Most patients carry mutations in **hemojuvelin (HJV)**, also called RGMc (repulsive guidance molecule c)

**HJV Function:**

- Expressed mainly in skeletal muscle, heart, and to a lesser extent in liver
- Exists as both soluble and membrane protein forms
- The soluble protein interacts with **BMP (bone morphogenetic protein)**, possibly as a co-receptor
- Signals via the **SMAD pathway** to regulate hepcidin expression
- Most patients with mutant HJV have low to undetectable urinary hepcidin levels
- This suggests that hemojuvelin is a **positive regulator of hepcidin**

#### 3. Iron Deficiency Anemia

**Causes:**

- Most common: Blood loss (intestinal bleeding, menstruation)
- Globally, more than one billion people may be affected
- Most common cause worldwide: Parasitic infection (hookworms, whipworms, roundworms) causing undetected intestinal blood loss
- Malaria infections destroy red blood cells and, combined with hookworm infections, contribute to anemia in developing countries
- In developed countries: ~20% of women of childbearing age have iron deficiency anemia (vs. 3% of men) due to uncompensated menstrual iron loss
- In post-menopausal adults (over 50): Chronic gastrointestinal bleeding from non-parasitic causes (gastric ulcer, duodenal ulcer, gastrointestinal cancer)

**Hepcidin Response:**

In iron deficiency, hepcidin is appropriately suppressed, allowing maximal iron absorption and release from stores.

### Summary of Hepcidin's Pathological Significance

| Condition | Hepcidin Level | Ferroportin Activity | Iron Status |
|-----------|----------------|---------------------|-------------|
| **Normal** | Normal | Regulated | Balanced |
| **Anemia of Chronic Disease** | HIGH (overexpressed) | LOW (degraded) | Low plasma iron, iron trapped in cells |
| **Hemochromatosis** | LOW (reduced expression) | HIGH (active) | Iron overload |
| **Iron Deficiency** | LOW (appropriately suppressed) | HIGH | Enhanced absorption |

### Clinical Implications

Understanding hepcidin's role in iron metabolism has significant clinical implications:

1. **Diagnostic applications**: Hepcidin levels can help differentiate types of anemia
2. **Therapeutic targets**: Hepcidin modulators may be useful in treating iron disorders
3. **Infection management**: The iron-withholding response is an important defense mechanism
4. **Hereditary hemochromatosis**: Understanding hepcidin pathways helps explain the genetics of iron overload disorders

### Conclusion

Hepcidin is the central regulatory hormone of iron metabolism, controlling iron absorption and distribution by regulating the ferroportin iron exporter. Its synthesis is carefully regulated by iron status, erythropoietic demand, hypoxia, and inflammation. Hepcidin deficiency leads to iron overload (hemochromatosis), while hepcidin excess leads to iron-restricted anemia (anemia of chronic disease). The discovery of hepcidin has revolutionized our understanding of iron homeostasis and opened new avenues for the diagnosis and treatment of iron disorders.
