# Physiology Learning Objectives

## Introduction

The learning objectives below summarize the most important concepts required on the exams (written and oral). They consist of 3 parts:
1. Title
2. Learning objectives
3. Reference values

The learning objectives that appear in **bold RED color** indicate those objectives and reference values that will serve as questions in the entry part of the exam. Not knowing or giving inadequate response to these objectives or reference values during any part of the exams will result in a failed (1) exam.

**Important:** On the oral exams the picked topic (card) will contain ONLY the title, not the detailed objectives.
