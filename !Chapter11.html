    <h2>What is the difference between ‘brainwashing’ and socialisation?</h2>
    <p>
      Socialisation is the lifelong process through which people learn the values, norms and 
      behaviours needed to function in society. It connects generations and equips individuals 
      with language, beliefs and skills so they can participate in social life. Brainwashing, by 
      contrast, is a coercive form of indoctrination in which a doctrine is imposed without 
      allowing critical thought. Socialisation encourages adaptation and autonomy, whereas 
      brainwashing suppresses questioning and promotes uncritical acceptance of a single set of 
      beliefs.

    <h2>What kind of orphanage system works in your country?</h2>
    <p>
      In the United States, the traditional orphanage has been replaced by a foster care system. 
      Children who cannot live with their parents are placed with relatives, licensed foster 
      parents or group homes. The state arranges the placement through child‑protection 
      agencies and stands in loco parentis (in place of the parent) for legal decisions. Foster 
      parents receive financial support to cover the child’s needs, and birth parents usually retain 
      medical and educational rights unless these rights are terminated by a court.
    </p>

    <h2>What kind of socialisation process is typical among the poor families and migrants?</h2>
    <p>
      Sociologists have found that working‑class and poor families often follow an 
      “accomplishment of natural growth” approach. Parents provide basic necessities and allow 
      children to develop more independently. Children gain self‑sufficiency but may lack 
      structured extracurricular activities, adult advocacy and institutional connections that are 
      common in middle‑class families. Among migrants, socialisation is bicultural: parents 
      transmit elements of their home culture while encouraging children to learn the language 
      and norms of the host society. Migrant children often act as cultural brokers, navigating 
      between two worlds.
    </p>

    <h2>What kind of sexual orientations and gender types do you know?</h2>
    <p>
      Sexual orientation refers to patterns of romantic or sexual attraction. Examples include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Heterosexual:</strong> attraction to people of a different gender.</li>
      <li><strong>Gay or lesbian:</strong> attraction to people of one’s own gender.</li>
      <li><strong>Bisexual:</strong> attraction to more than one gender.</li>
      <li><strong>Pansexual:</strong> attraction regardless of gender identity.</li>
      <li><strong>Asexual:</strong> little or no sexual attraction; subcategories include demisexual and 
        gray‑asexual.</li>
      <li><strong>Aromantic:</strong> little or no romantic attraction.</li>
      <li><strong>Autoromantic or autosexual:</strong> attraction primarily toward oneself.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Gender identity goes beyond male and female to include non‑binary identities such as 
      gender‑fluid, agender and genderqueer. Some Indigenous cultures recognise a Two‑Spirit 
      identity that embodies both masculine and feminine qualities.
    </p>

    <h2>What kind of differences are between female and male medical students and doctors?</h2>
    <p>
      Medical education has historically centred on male role models. Male students are often 
      associated with heroic figures, whereas female students are portrayed as nurturing and 
      relationship‑oriented. These stereotypes shape expectations and career choices. 
      Research also reveals outcome differences: patients treated by female physicians tend 
      to experience lower mortality and hospital readmission rates than those treated by male 
      physicians. Female doctors often spend more time with patients, use shared decision‑making 
      and adhere closely to guidelines. Despite these strengths, women remain under‑represented 
      in many medical specialties, and implicit biases can affect evaluations and advancement.

    <h2>Define the term socialisation.</h2>
    <p>
      Socialisation is the process by which individuals learn the values, norms, behaviours and 
      cultural knowledge necessary to participate in society. Through socialisation, a helpless 
      infant becomes a self‑aware person capable of fulfilling social roles and contributing to 
      cultural continuity.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduce the agencies of socialisation.</h2>
    <p>Key settings in which socialisation occurs include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Family:</strong> teaches language, values and early behavioural patterns.</li>
      <li><strong>Schools:</strong> transmit knowledge, discipline and civic values.</li>
      <li><strong>Peer groups:</strong> provide an arena for developing identity and social skills.</li>
      <li><strong>Organisations and workplaces:</strong> socialise individuals into specific roles.</li>
      <li><strong>Media:</strong> shapes norms, aspirations and global awareness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Define primary and secondary socialisation.</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Primary socialisation</strong> occurs in early childhood—usually within the family—where 
      children learn language, values and foundational behaviours. 
      <strong>Secondary socialisation</strong> takes place later in life when individuals adapt to new roles or 
      institutions, such as schooling, workplaces or professional groups.
    </p>

    <h2>Define the term gender.</h2>
    <p>
      Gender refers to the social expectations and roles associated with being male or female. 
      Unlike biological sex, gender encompasses cultural norms, behaviours and identities that 
      vary across societies and change over time.
    </p>

    <h2>Introduce gender socialisation.</h2>
    <p>
      Gender socialisation is the process through which individuals learn culturally defined 
      gender roles. Families, schools and media communicate expectations—such as boys being 
      strong and girls caring for others—but contemporary societies increasingly offer more 
      diverse role models and recognise that gender identity may not align with biological sex.
    </p>

    <h2>Define professional socialisation.</h2>
    <p>
      Professional socialisation is the development of a professional identity through learning 
      specialised knowledge, values and behaviours. For medical students, this involves 
      interactions with teachers, physicians, nurses, patients and peers that shape their 
      attitudes, ethics and competence as future doctors.
    </p>

    <h2>Define indirect professional socialisation.</h2>
    <p>
      Indirect professional socialisation—sometimes called the hidden curriculum—refers to the 
      informal lessons learned outside the formal syllabus. Examples include the way courses are 
      scheduled, how seniors behave during clinical rounds, the camaraderie among students and 
      exposure to hospital culture. These experiences subtly shape professional norms, for 
      better or worse.
    </p>

    <h2>Define direct professional socialisation.</h2>
    <p>
      Direct professional socialisation encompasses the formal curriculum: lectures, laboratory 
      work, supervised clinical practice and assessments. Through these structured activities, 
      teachers transmit explicit standards of knowledge and behaviour expected of professionals.
    </p>

    <h2>Define gender hidden curriculum.</h2>
    <p>
      The gender hidden curriculum is the implicit reinforcement of gendered expectations in 
      professional training. Within medical education, male physicians are often portrayed as 
      heroic pioneers, while female physicians are depicted as caregivers. Such portrayals 
      influence how students perceive their future roles and can perpetuate stereotypes. 
      Recognising and challenging these implicit messages is essential for creating an 
      equitable profession.
